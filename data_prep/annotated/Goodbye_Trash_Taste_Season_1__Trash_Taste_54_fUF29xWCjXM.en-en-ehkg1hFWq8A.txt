<SPEAKER_04> - Can't believe
"manoeuvre" has an O in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who decided that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can't believe
"manoeuvre" has an O in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who decided that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Manoeuvre! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm still reeling over this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've deadass never seen that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I stopped trying to learn
language a long time ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (chill music plays) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hello and welcome to another
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And this is, this is I'd
say a special one, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's the last
episode you're gonna see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this studio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, Chris's thing fell as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anyway.
- Anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We definitely didn't script that bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm your host for today, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And with me are Joey and Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And, yeah, boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How are you doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Sad to be moving out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - A little. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A little sad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just a very busy time right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've got so much to
do with the new studio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, all right, we gotta record one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> before we start the studio down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're probably gonna
film a short little vlog </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for "After Dark" as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which will hopefully be up by this time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It'll probably be out before this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, go check out "After Dark." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we are literally moving out tomorrow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after we film this today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, by the time this comes out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this will probably be like
four, three, four weeks after. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It still hasn't sunken in
that we're moving out tomorrow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It hasn't sunk in for me yet either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just dreading
having to redo everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and set everything up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause, you know, we have
a setup that works here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone's like, "Why are you moving? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why are you moving?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But you gotta mix it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, you gotta keep it fresh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, you'll see why we want to move </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you watch the "After Dark" vlog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we have no fucking space in here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm glad that I don't have to, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dread whenever I'm the host </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause people don't know
the fucking obstacle course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to go around to
get to this host chair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel literally bad
for every guest that comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to our show.
- Yeah, we do have a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who has to like perform
parkour to get to their seat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of tripping hazards and yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ladybeard nearly tested
the limits of our set </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in multiple ways, not
just the shelf behind you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but all the wires and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That man was too large and
in charge for those wires. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't imagine how the
guest feels having to sit here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and having like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what if you need to go
to the toilet, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause the reason, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason I hate going on flights </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and sitting on the window
seat is I hate not being able </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to access the toilet under my own will. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I, dude, I know now
my limits of my own bladder. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, now whenever I'm on a long
flight, I'm like, aisle seat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Give me the aisle seat immediately. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't have to look at the view. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've seen, I know what the
outside of a plane looks like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know what sky looks like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't need to look at sky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know what a city looks like from above. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will sacrifice, I will- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, hold up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, this is gonna be
our first topic for fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Listen, okay, I am a firm window seat fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll tell you why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's the biggest downside of being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in the aisle, gentlemen? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is it? Come on, there's gotta be one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Downside? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There isn't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That you don't see the view? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There is one glaring
gigantic annoying issue, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and that is motherfucking
people in the window </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and middle seat wanting to get out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And God forbid, they're
fucking clumsy as shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like, "Oh!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, fucking falling over everything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they've got like 10 shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they got on their lap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They got like the whole
fucking family buffet and shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They got like 10 headphones,
portable charger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, for fuck's sake,
put it in your fucking bag. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They're trying to shimmy around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, get that shit away from
me. I want to go to the window </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I want to sleep and I
don't want to be disturbed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you're okay with disturbing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That just shows like the
difference in mentality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I would rather, I'm
fine with being disturbed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "Go to the toilet, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "I know you need to." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - His voice with that, "I'm
fine with being disturbed." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Listen, I don't, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if everyone else
sees it the same way as I do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I know that I get
annoyed by minor things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My house could burn down and I'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "That's fucking really
inconvenient, now isn't it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But someone moves in the
aisle seat, "For fuck's sake!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, because for me
there's like a counter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, because I know how much I piss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I'm glad that
I don't need to worry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how much I piss on "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I piss a lot on "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But in the confines of an
airplane, you are stuck there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And you ask to go to the toilet once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, that's reasonable, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone has, everyone
knows everyone needs to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to the toilet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But twice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, that's kinda pushing it, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> What if I need to go three
times when everyone's sleeping? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What if that just happens? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're more worried
about pissing them off? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I'm more worried
about pissing them off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Picture it, you're on
the aisle, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is the limit before
you start to get annoyed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> with how many times people
will get up to go and pee? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're on a 12 hour flight.
- For me, it doesn't matter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because no matter what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna be pissing more than
these two people combined. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - For me, I never get pissed off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm like, "I get it, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "I know the pain you're in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "I know the trouble you're in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "I got you, brother." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's my mentality, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The aisle people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the aisle chumps are
used to being annoyed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's my theory, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I don't really feel bad
about disturbing in the aisle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm fucking zen on the aisle, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The middle seat you just lose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, they already knew they lost. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The middle seat is just the loser seat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No one ever wants to
sit in the middle seat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that you're a fucking psychopath </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you actually choose to
sit in the middle seat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is like, okay, well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the only time I don't give
a about middle seat is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if we're on like an hour or two flight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, that's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally I watch one Jason
Statham movie and I'm there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, I mean, I do care
on a 12 hour flight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But you've already lost at that point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you should have pre-booked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's your fault. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But do you ever do that
gamble where you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I want the whole row to myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This plane looks just empty enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "where I think I can pull this off." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm gonna book just the middle seat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "in a clean row of three." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I never. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like to live life on the edge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I know that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what sick fuck is gonna
wanna sit next to a madman </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that would willingly choose the aisle seat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a row of three? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That should be like a danger sign. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because what I do is
that I get the safe seat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of just an aisle seat 'cause
I know that no matter what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> even if that aisle was full,
I get the extra leg room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get immediate access to the toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't disturb anybody. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a win win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But then the moment I get
on the plane and I see, oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not a lot of people waiting in
this waiting room right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Then that's when I go like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "So how many aisles are open today? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How many aisles? "Can I
sneak into one of those?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And like I just ask, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and a lot of the times
they're just like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but that's when it's empty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's when it's empty. And
also I don't ask, I just go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The moment the plane, like,
the seatbelt things come on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "That's a free aisle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "That's mine." I could see
other people on the plane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I see their eyes looking
at the free seats. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "No, it's mine." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Out of the way!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Get down!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's the other benefit of being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in the aisle, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You immediately just go "Go now!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah, I mean, it's
rare that I'm on a plane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like, where
there's an aisle there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm pretty sure the
gamble you're making is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like fucking gacha odds, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am talking about
when the plane is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> basically like 70 to 80% full. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, again like I said, no one... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you were on the
booking page of the plane, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get to see the layout as you do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not gonna sit next to the guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who picked willingly the middle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's a bad sign. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I saw someone in the middle, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "He's a psychopath. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "That's a psychopath." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He wants to "socialize" on the plane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm like, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not falling for this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not here to fucking socialize. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to join a cult today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure there'll be some cult. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I don't mind going on the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, so, again I'll do that gamble. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If it doesn't work out, I might (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I might go to like
whoever's next to me like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "You wanna swap? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Wanna swap?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you actually? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Listen, I'm gonna sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Do you wanna swap?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they're like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, how easily do you sleep on planes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember when I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With great difficulty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With great difficulty? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sleeping on the window seat
is actually less comfortable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than sleeping on the aisle seat as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because for some reason like you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, you know, your nature is, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can lean on the wall part, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But the wall of the plane is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why it's just
tilted at such an angle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can never get a
comfortable leaning on that wall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is why you bring a pillow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know what engineer
designed it to make planes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially on the window seat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the most uncomfortable
angle to lean your head by. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that is true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is so weird because I have
no trouble sleeping on cars. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cars, trains, any other
kind of moving vehicle, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I sleep like a fucking baby. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Put me on a plane, and I'm like insomnia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, insomnia speed runner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I normally wear
a hoodie and a jacket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no matter what the weather. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll use them as padding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because it also gets
fucking cold on the plane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I need to be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need my head to be at
least like a 45 degree angle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's called privilege.
- No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, like, like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - How does sleeping in the
aisle make this solution better? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I can't tilt my
neck enough that it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's almost like horizontal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's how, I kind of
go like the wall is here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the seat is here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of nestle into this corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Kind of like go in like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause like for me, like I said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my head needs to be like at
at least a 45 degree angle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So not, you know, not my entire body, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but at least my head, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, it feels at least like I'm lying down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though I wake up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I get fucking neck cramps or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just go business. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, at that point just go business. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly I have no
problem just sleeping, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like, I just put my head down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just sleep on my arms on my lap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I can't do that.
- I can do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have attempted to do that as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm too tall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] That sounds like a
short person solution to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is what happens when
you're lower than 6', Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Just the world opens up to you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like fucking origami. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The 5'11" club over here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly every time I go on a plane, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, "Damn, man,
I wish I was a bit shorter." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "I wish I was the 5'11" club." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "How's it feel to be short?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that's the other benefit
to being in the aisle seat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right, is that you can stick your legs out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and actually stretch them out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, you can't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can do 10 minutes
and the woman comes over, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> she's like, "Hey, put
your fucking legs in." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or the cart comes by, and
you're legs get fucking cut off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I'm like fucking right
up against the seat though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so it just slides past. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a Jackie Chan film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just past. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I also, I don't
know if I can do this now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's been like two years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> since I've been on a long flight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's been awhile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's been like two years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but I used to stay up all night working, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then my flight would be at like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, maybe mid day if I was lucky. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe 8:00 AM if I was even luckier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I'd stay up all night working, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then right before I got on the plane, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would just take one of
those over the counter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really cheap week sleeping
pills you can get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The UK ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they're super, they're not- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, melatonin? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Melatonin's the good shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's illegal in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or you need a prescription
to get melatonin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really?
- I think the one that you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from the store is like
similar to hayfever medicine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, like drowsy medicine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I swear to God, that's just sugar pills. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I swear to God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't actually do much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's enough to like
kind of get your head going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, "All right,
I'm already sleep deprived. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I stayed up all night working, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "and now I'm gonna go to bed." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like when I
would, when, what was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Two and a half years ago, maybe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the last con season I
actually did before pandemic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went back and forth from
America like four times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in one month to the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And the only way I could
do it was by sleeping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I need to sleep on a plane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't have like melatonin
or like sleeping pills- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never taken melatonin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just go like, "Just give
me like two gin and tonics." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Just down that shit and zonk out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Alcohol doesn't work
on me to make me sleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me, I never drink alcohol on planes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because alcohol just makes the fluids run </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> through my body faster,
so I just gotta pee more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that just adds an extra
layer of stress for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well, I gotta pee more
now I'm on this plane." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can not pee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I can hold the pee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I can not pee." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's an out of context clip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can hold the pee for
like the whole 12 hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're a mad man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I unload before I get on the plane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Unload!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I fully unleash it and I drink
minimal water on the plane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm pretty sure I unload
as much as I possibly can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I go to pee like five times
before I get on the plane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like, I sit down immediately- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You're peeing five times
before you get on the plane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Your bladder already
sounds like it's failed you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before you even got to the
gate. I'm only peeing like once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't know what it is though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a Pavlovian effect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where like the moment you hear the "ding" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the seatbelt sign, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh fuck, I have to pee." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Every time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's what I can hold it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I can sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I'm like, I tell
the people next to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if they seem nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> If they don't seem nice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I won't even say anything 'cause. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tell them what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll just be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "If the food comes, don't wake me up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't care about the food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Don't wake me up for anything." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought you were
gonna say, "Don't worry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Don't worry if you have to pee
'cause I'm all for it, man." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause sometimes if you're gonna sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and they ask you, "Do you want food?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And they think that you're
like actually like conked out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like completely, they might think like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh my God, he's like, he's
fainted," or something or like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I've just, if I'm on a plane- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you don't wake up.
If you don't wake up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, if I'm on a plane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm asleep while the food goes past, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I've never been woken up for food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, I've had people
wake me up so many times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate that actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm like, "Do you
know how hard I worked?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For those five minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I waited two hours to get to
sleep for five fucking minutes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you could wake me up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> This is why I also don't
want to sit in the fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the aisle because the
moment I fall asleep, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some person's gonna be like, "Excuse me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Can I go to the toilet?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You literally waited. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You waited until I fell asleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fucking piece of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're a scum of the earth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I will watch the moment I see
them about to fall asleep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I'm gonna pee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I'm like I wanna
give you some time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, there's only one
thing that annoys me more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about getting woken up just
to eat, you know, on a plane, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I wasn't even
hungry in the first place, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that is babies on a plane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, man... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Crying babies on a plane just
triggers something in me, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it should be legally allowed- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you have noise-canceling headphones? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're a lifesaver. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally the, what are they called? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, I feel like a baby's
cry pierces any kind of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Dude, those Sony WX 4,000,
whatever the fuck they are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The stupidest name they
ever picked for them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There's amazing
noise-canceling headphones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You won't hear a fucking thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause I've, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't usually use
noise-canceling headphones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That might be my problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because right now I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it should be legally
allowed to punch babies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if they cry on a plane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, that's, can we
all just agree on that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Shut up!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like they might cry more, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how the parents
would feel about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have to hit them just right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it's like "Mad Max"
when the baby starts crying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Parents are like fucking... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right man, problem solved. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never thought I needed- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, "Austin Powers" judo chop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Judo chop! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - My God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never thought I needed
noise-canceling headphones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until I had them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I can't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally go everywhere with them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you see me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do not go anywhere without
my noise-canceling headphones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would only use
noise-canceling headphones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> for the airplane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what you think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, in what other like situations? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so nice on the train
or any form of transport, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> walking around, just getting isolated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and hearing your music and just the music. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you want, you can
hear some background noise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't really matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, it's like living through an AMV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to hear Philip DeFranco </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I'm walking downtown going, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What's up, beautiful
bastards?" in my ear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right in my, it's like ASMR. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right in my ear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All I want to hear is Phil in my ear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like I zone out enough as it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't need noise-canceling headphones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd literally just walk in
front of a truck or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I had noise-canceling headphones on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you kinda, you learn
to adapt. (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You become more wary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I look around a lot more now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is a good thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kind of like Daredevil, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You take out one sense, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so you gotta compensate for
it with your other sense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just buy them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You'll see, you'll see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they're great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I always thought
like expensive headphones, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "I don't need more than 20 bucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "or 50 bucks headphones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "What a scam." And then I
bought them and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm such a fool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "I was so wrong the whole time." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The beeps and boops
sound even better now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, they are amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Changes everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did used to have like
really, really good headphones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they were just a real hassle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Beats by Dre. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - They were just like a real
hassle to just lug around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why I stopped using them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why mine, mine are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they fold into themselves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Pretty easy to put in a
coat pocket or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just use the AirPods. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's why I like
using like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> earbuds whenever it's daily life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If it's on a plane, yeah,
I'll bring the headphones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wear the headphones everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - See like especially this time, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't mind the headphones either, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but like this time of year
when it gets hot as shit- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate having headphones around my neck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I need something to
distract me from the heat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so I just blast some audio. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Add more heat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Take one, take one- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Add more insulation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Take one of the senses away from me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so I can just go to another world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have to fuckin' pay
attention to Japan anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I hate that because
I start sweating here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like on my ears, and then
when I take it off, it's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you have a lot of hair
though, so that might be why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I don't really have like
that much hair around here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, that's probably it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like muffling
all the hair in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like fucking making- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have to like fucking
like raise it up like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like hear anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt will be fine then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you're good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You two are fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we're fine.
- I'll be good, I'll be good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Soon I'll have no hair
then they'll be no problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then you'll just have
like a sunburn mark. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Looking forward to getting
sunburned on your head, Connor? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just gonna become a hat guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Beanie guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You already are starting
to become a hat guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Every time I see you in the summer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, 'cause I realized
that like it fucking hurts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to not wear a hat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It hurts? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The sun hurts so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's what the biggest
thing that changed to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was walking today to
the train and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when did I just like hate seeing the sun? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, when did that happen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember I
didn't mind being outside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But now I hate the
thought of having the sun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on my skin at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sounds like the most British thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I've ever heard honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't used to be this way.
I don't know what happened! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I just hate the sun." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, can you tan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I just burn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But now I actually like, if
I stay in the sun too long, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like nauseous real fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without like a hat or anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel that's like a different- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it just because it's too hot? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think maybe here, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's just way
harder than I'm used to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also because of
the humidity, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the humidity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like you're just,
it's more, it's not the sun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just the heat because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's both, it's both. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - In like England, the sun
fucking tickles you, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't feel anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, I feel like
they play off each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, the sun makes the humidity worse, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then the humidity makes the sun worse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because when the sun's beaming on you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like LA or whatever, it's not too bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously I don't wanna stand- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It hurts.
- I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know.
- It hurts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not saying it's great, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean, it's better
than it is in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just 'cause the humidity
makes it feel 10 times worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if there's
some like ray bullshit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like mimic, like, you know,
going in the water droplets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the air fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the frogs they're making the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if there's
some shit going on there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some conspiracy theory shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's probably someone smarter than me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who can figure it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's honestly, I think it's
just like a preference thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, some people are like,
"Yeah, humidity's whatever." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there are others who are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh yeah, my skin is
like physically burning." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like a little bit of humidity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese humidity is like way too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Last summer I could like
only survive by going around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with like a fucking UV umbrella. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Felt like an old woman. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's right.
- I felt like an old woman. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would just go around with
like this foldable umbrella </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that I would just go around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd be like, "Don't talk to me." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I can't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The first time I saw you
with that, I thought... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Are you waiting
for me to like say a joke or?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I realized it's not enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to just protect my head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Is this a bit?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It started, like, even
the hat didn't really help </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that much, and I needed
to cover like my neck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like my arms and shoulders. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You need to get those like visors that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm one, yeah, I'm one step away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from being the old
woman at the supermarket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they wear like sleeves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, shade sleeves and
like a full like neck thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for the sun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shout out to those of us
who've never been sunburned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in our lives. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is this a white man problem
that I just don't get? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I'm aging rapidly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Imagine sunburning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine sunburning, oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Imagine being hurt by this
natural occurring thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's existed since the
beginning of our planet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like my body didn't age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it decided that
everything would just kick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> into overdrive and start aging
rapidly from age like 23. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We went to Japan and it
just made me feel old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So now- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally the youngest man in the room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My UV umbrella broke and shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It snapped. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It broke? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It broke. I don't know how it broke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did the sun snap it?
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The rays were too heavy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - How did it break? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How the fuck did it break? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know when you pull it out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it was one of the foldable ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, you can fit it into a small bag. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It just like when I
pulled it out one time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it just fucking came off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess no sun protection
for the day then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, so now I need to buy a new one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been looking on Amazon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but one hasn't caught my
fancy yet, so we'll see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm very picky. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is this a fashion statement
or something as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I just wanted one that
wouldn't break, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I've been burned once, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twice now, from the sun
and from the umbrella. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just buy a more sturdy one surely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh thanks, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's an umbrella! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a fucking umbrella. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How wrong can an umbrella be? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Does it protect you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Does it give you shade? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's all it needs to do surely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I mean, you know, 'cause- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then why the fuck you
worried about like the design? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I already look
like a clown using it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to at least not make
it too bad and get like a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> if I get a pink one, it'd look pretty bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I want to try and get like somewhat- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nothing wrong with pink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could rock it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't want to have to
justify why I'm rocking it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why are you like
trying to prove a point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I could own it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't want to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I have no qualms with
having a pink umbrella </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if that's what you're wondering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was the most like
roundabout way of saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yes, but also no." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll get a pink umbrella, fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll buy a pink umbrella.
- Yeah, get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Do it for the bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fine, fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No one's gonna see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's literally- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll put it on Twitter, don't worry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's for the bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My daily life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> My daily life is a joke.
- We'll put it on the Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't worry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Subreddit will go ham
on that, don't worry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's fucking talk
about something serious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shut the fuck up, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, let's not do that. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> (Connor speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck you, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Script reading, big brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, in other news,
there's something happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is something less light-hearted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and more serious that
has happened recently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was trying to find
a little like downtime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> before we go onto that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess we'll go straight into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's just go straight
into depression, so... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How can we say this, boys? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One of the greatest manga artists- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One of my fucking heroes just died. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One of the greatest
manga artists of all time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just passed away recently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Old news by the time this comes out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - By the time this comes out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this will be like a month old news now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, Kentaro Miura, author
of "Berserk" has passed away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Age 54, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, age 54. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Of like, what did he die of? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I forgot the scientific name of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like one of
his like main arteries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in his heart just like exploded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Essentially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So basically it's a heart attack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, but yeah, it's a
fucking horrible way to die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll tell you honestly,
after hearing about this news, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm never gonna make fun
of a hiatus ever again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No, like legit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's scary, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, because... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, because, you know,
obviously no one really knew </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as to why he was on hiatus, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no one knew. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They normally don't
usually give reasons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - People are extremely versatile. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "He/she is on hiatus,
just deal with it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, yeah, apparently, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Was he sick or was it
just completely sudden? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> At the time of recording, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't read enough about what happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to know if it was like a
reoccurring health problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or if it was just a sudden thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But man, like we all know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how much pressure manga
artists get put through anyway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and how much work they have
to do on a weekly basis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it's crazy to think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that most of the big manga
artists we know about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, working shonen jump or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get like two weeks off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, less than two weeks
off every year, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like golden week and
then like one extra week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I doubt they take it as
well. I doubt they take it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they don't really, I
doubt they take it off as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just one week where they are forced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to take a break, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I wasn't too
familiar with "Berserk." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd only watched the 90s anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's familiar enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really enjoyed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was very good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck, I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just kind of sad hearing
like a legend of the industry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's kind of influenced a
lot of things that we've done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I remember we were
filming another project </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when the news broke to us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it didn't hit me immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was in like work
mode, I was in filming mode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I was like, "Okay, I
gotta do this, this, this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it got home,
listened to Guts' theme once, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just played continuously
for like the entire night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just sitting
there just like fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like part of my soul had died. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I literally went
home and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm gonna reread 'Berserk.'" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I feel like everyone did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I started reading it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I couldn't get past volume
one without feeling like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this fucking wave of like, oh fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause like I always know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that "Berserk" is one
of the greatest manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has ever been made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then going back home and realizing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just remembering everything
that was in this story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and in this manga, it just
hit even fucking harder </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I just had
forgotten how good it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before I really took the time to remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what it had achieved and
some of its greatest moments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you hadn't read "Berserk," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's always a perfect
time to read "Berserk" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because anytime is the perfect
time to read "Berserk." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, please read fucking "Berserk." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean the manga single-handedly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> inspired the Dark Souls series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it inspired a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It wasn't just Dark Souls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of things wouldn't exist right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if not for "Berserk." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I don't know what
it is about "Berserk," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's literally like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally the one
show, or not even one show, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one story or the one manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that seems to be like no matter
how tough this person is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no matter how like detached
they are from the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or whatever, "Berserk"
seems to be that one story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that seems to be able to
affect anyone who reads it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because like
fundamentally, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like this whole
like dark fantasy thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with these like mythical creatures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's bloody, gory and, you know, epic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like the main themes
mostly are just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, one person trying to figure out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck they want to do in life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like that's a theme </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that literally anyone
can get behind, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I'm kind of in this world,
shit's happening around me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really know what
my purpose is in life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I forgot how brutal it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's brutal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Again, I watched all the 90s anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The 90s anime is brutal as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Oh my God." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's just like, fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It just hurts to read. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] It does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so uncomfortable at times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and I think it's incredible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it is really,
really fucking brutal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There are some like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like his art, obviously we
haven't talked about his art yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like some of the
best art to ever exist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the world of manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, some of the horrific
imagery he managed to conjure up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and some of like the creature designs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything were
just something straight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of a nightmare, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's a brutal show and
it's an action packed show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Guts is like one of the biggest
badasses in anime and manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And yet having said all that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the moments that people remember are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the really intimate moments, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which isn't what you think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you looked at "Berserk"
on a surface level, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You look at "Berserk" you
see these horrific creatures, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see Guts with a massive
sword tearing shit up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, "Yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "This is a manly man show." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you read it and you're
just like fucking crying inside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because, you know, you see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to see Guts like
get through his trauma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and find his journey and
everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's the real intimate moments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that always stand out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's the real serene
moments that always stand out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think that's what
really sets "Berserk" apart </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from like so many other series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's the serene moments juxtaposed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> against all like the horrific moments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that make it one of, to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's one of my
favorite pieces of fiction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's ever been made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I got reminded of that
after remembering everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that "Berserk" did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like if the fucking
Doom guy had like a wife </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and family and he just
went home sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get reminded like,
"Oh shit, this is a guy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because when you're- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Doom guy's like, "Why
am I killing these?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What is my purpose?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was really, I, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I don't know why
someone compared it on Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought, I guess so,
but then I read "Berserk." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it is kind of like, you do forget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause sometimes like you're reading it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, this is like so Doom-esque </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where he's just literally
just beheading horses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, "Oh, this is like Doom." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it's like really
sad and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "This isn't like Doom." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally that meme
where the girls were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I can't believe he
didn't cry during Titanic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Do boys even have feelings?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like there's just the
boys crying over Guts' theme, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was literally what
I was doing that night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just Guts' theme was playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was just like crying in bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Just like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, every time I re-read it,
it's just because. you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> every time a new volume came out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was so much time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in between like the later volumes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Well, fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I guess I have to read
it from scratch again." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I would keep reading
it from scratch over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and over again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's one of those
shows where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how does this not get like stale? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I probably read it,
like the first 30 volumes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> probably like a good,
like maybe 10, 20 times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, how does this
keep just getting better? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, how do I keep
finding new things in this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you guys know me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't fucking rewatch anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I refuse to rewatch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But even just rereading the first, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what is the first one called? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "The Golden Age." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "The Golden Age," that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just rereading that again, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Holy shit, this was so good." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, even though I've seen
this, I've read it earlier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I tried to read it again
ages ago for some reason now- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes when I'm bored, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just like go to the eclipse
arc and just look at the art. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, how can one
person think of this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the dude was like 15 as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when he like first came up
with the concept of the zone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you see the manga
he made before "Berserk" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when he was actually 15?
- He was like 15 or 16. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's better than most
modern manga artists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, this is not the
art skill of a 15-year-old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like he paired that talent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and he just kept improving
on it to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where literally, I dunno,
there's only like a few people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in the world who I think
can even match, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the talent that he puts
into the panels that he did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I saw this like
really interesting interview </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with him like after, you
know, his death was announced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where like apparently
one of the big reasons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as to why he was on hiatus was
because he got so infatuated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with detail that it would
literally get to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where he would zoom in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like actually edit
every fucking pixel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like he- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds like a prison, that's perfection. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and he kept, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting like on hiatus
over and over again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And his, you know, editors would be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "You can't even see this detail on paper. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "So like just stop." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was just like, "No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I have to get this right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I have to get this perfect." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, like some of
the panels he's done belongs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in a museum, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like the reason for that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I just remember like
that night when I went back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just like went to look
at some of the panels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just remember staring
at them for such a long time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know when
you're reading a story, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes, you know, you
wanna see what happens next. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you don't read it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't appreciate the art at the moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you first read it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I went back to look
at some of the panels, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just, the amount of
work and amount of detail </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the amount of vision that was put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into these panels were fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did not appreciate
it fully the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though I could
tell these were amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't take the time to fully appreciate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how fucking amazing
some of these panels are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they are incredible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] 100%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They, you know, they are
just basically the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as any other painting or any other art. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really want to know if they have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a "Berserk" art book of some kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I would fucking purchase
that in a heartbeat, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they'll probably end
up doing something soon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to celebrate the legacy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hope they do like open
up an exhibit or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause that would be absolutely amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause if there's one, you know, one manga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that deserves an exhibit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that deserves the artwork
to be plastered on the wall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's Miura, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fucking "Berserk." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 100%. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was kind of sad to see
that a lot of people were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just like, "Well, what's
gonna happen to the story?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Those aren't fans of "Berserk." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's frustrating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause when I saw the
announcement on Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there were so many people being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Does this mean it's not gonna finish?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, yes, no shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me, it's just so, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how about you just give
them a chance to like grieve </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before you ask these questions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If anything I'm kind of- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The answer's probably gonna be no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because there were a lot
of people as well being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, but you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "they can probably just
get like Miura's assistants </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "to finish it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I would rather it just be where it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Just end it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm fine with it being
an unfinished masterpiece, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's fine for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's "Berserk"- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was it realistically ever
gonna finish, do you think? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I don't think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like, not a single one
of like the, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Kings were killed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think only one of them was killed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] I think one of them was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So, there was a long, long way to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We were so early in the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the pace that the
story was progressing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I doubt it would have finished
in our lifetime or, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was always
going to be unfinished. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think "Berserk" has
already achieved enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that it doesn't need to be finished. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it was like what I said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we talked about last time
we spoke about reading manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I just get to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I often get to a point when
I'm reading manga I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm satisfied. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I genuinely, it'd be
cool if this ends nicely, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "but I've read up to a point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "where I feel like I'm happy
with what I've been given." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like "Berserk"
has definitely done that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's been plenty
of moments in "Berserk" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that have felt like a resolution moment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a big resolution moment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even though not every
plot detail was resolved, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though not every
loose end was tied up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it's resolved
enough in my heart </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make it like impact me
this much already, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think "Berserk," you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the journey of Guts is already
amazing enough as it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And some journeys, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some journeys don't need
to come to an end on paper, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen enough of the
journey where I'm satisfied. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just knowing that he's
out there somewhere still. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Looking for the end, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With the biggest fucking sword. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fat fucking sword. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, honestly I don't
know what else to say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just, it's a story
that has impacted me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If there's anything we can say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on this "Trash Taste" episode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's please go read "Berserk." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Give it a go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pay respect to the king. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, he is a king. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's the fucking GOAT, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hope, you know, if we find
out more about the details </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of, you know, what might've
caused his early death, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that if it is something to
do with being overworked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything, the lifestyle, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I hope it does
make a change, if it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't know that, obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We might never know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But if we do find out more details, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it becomes publicly
available, and we, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we know that maybe being overworked is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think it would be
good to at least, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of put into the public discussion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, you know, even if you are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, you have, 'cause
normally with heart problems </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and this kind of blood stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's normally there is some
hereditary stuff at play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean still at 54 is young. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, that... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Lifestyle would have to have an effect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just want mangas to
not have so much stress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on their body where it fails, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel bad, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It makes me feel shitty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, it sucks
because like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's not really much I can add to that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because manga artists work a hell of a- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We know, we know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We know they work way too hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whether voluntarily or not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the deadlines that they set themselves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or are set on them are too much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And it doesn't help that
fans are so demanding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And that for some fucking reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first question that some fans have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when an author dies is
what happens to the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I mean, it feels so selfish, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it feels, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because we as fans also have
something where we're selfish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, like
surprisingly, from what I saw, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there weren't as many of those comments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't that bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just sours your taste
when you see even one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every now and then
I saw it and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, clearly you don't
really give a shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, none of them said offensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There were just some
of the insensitive ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It reminds me of a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's like when there's
earthquakes and stuff, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but people are always just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, the manga it's delayed
'cause of an earthquake?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, people like people die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, earthquakes are no fucking joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like the people
that most, I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously with this situation
is very sensitive, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was very fresh
and a lot of people care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I noticed, especially with
like earthquakes and stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that people are very quick to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, who gives a shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's just an earthquake." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "It happens all the time." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it plays into
the overall sentiment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of that a lot of anime fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and manga fans are very
demanding for the stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like we as fans
need to chill out a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they care about the product, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but not so much about
the person making it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I feel like we as fans
generally need to chill out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about our passion for anime and manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - External things happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It is what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Remember that some actual
person is making your product. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whether it be an earthquake
or personal stress, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're all valid reasons
for work to be delayed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Give them some respect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just want creators to
be able to create the shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to the best of their ability
and not have to worry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hope that's not
controversial for me to say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What a hot take! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Respect staff members. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, I just feel
like when you say this shit- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's people behind the work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I'm sure everyone can agree on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just more, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure 99% of people
watching this don't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just that 1%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's always that 1%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this reminds me of like
the "Game of Thrones" thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with JRR Martin where I remember
like seeing an interview </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with him and he said that he got annoyed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that some people were
worried about his health </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not because they were
worried about his health, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they're worried if he would be alive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to finish "Game of Thrones." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, yeah,
that's pretty fucked up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like fans are saying
that to you, aren't they. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And even if they didn't say it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure he knows that people
are probably thinking it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, he can read between the lines. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People only care about his well-being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of the book. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, he's being fucking
held hostage by the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't fucking do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If anyone knows the intention
of "Game of Thrones" fans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the guy who made "Game of Thrones." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just sad, it's just sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, this makes me sad for
like many reasons, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's just so much at play. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is well, I mean, it's
a sad topic unfortunately. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's all about the respect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's all it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Respect the creators, respect the artists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Give them some space
if they're feeling sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or need a break. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Moving on to lighter topics though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I heard you've been watching
anime recently, Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kinda yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is a rare feat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember I used to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The anime man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What happened? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you guys watch
"Castlevania," the new season? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have not.
- Not season four. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro, it's so- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But we haven't talked about
"Castlevania" yet, have we? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so good, it's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean with how, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I've watched up to season three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If there's one anime I have
like kind of caught up to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's "Castlevania." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where did you get up
to in "Castlevania?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got up to season three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I haven't finished season three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm about halfway through season three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean, it's just been for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been getting better
and better every season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as it's been going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just haven't had
time to binge it yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything about that anime,
especially the past season, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just blew it out the water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's so good about it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I feel like
everything that was good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in previous seasons was
at its best this season. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The story was the best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The animation was just insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, some of the fights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even though in season three, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fights like the
final fight was so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even season one had
some crazy animation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just feels like
they've stepped it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like again, like I think
one of the strongest points </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of "Castlevania" has
been the voice acting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The English voice acting- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The English voice acting is fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, the fact that they
have like all the accents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on point, none of the accents feel silly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every single accent
that the characters have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it feels genuine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every single British accent is on point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> How do they do this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This never happens in anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How did they get an actual accent? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like they hired British actors. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love the fact that
for example the JoJo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the dub like tried to do the accent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I wish they'd got the native people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like in "JoJo Part One," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's Johnny Yong Bosch
doing in a British accent, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which isn't bad.
- Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which isn't bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But I know there's no
shortage of native English, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> British accents that can work in LA. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It feels like the
voice actors they hired </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for "Castlevania" were
just outside of your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> usual anime voice actors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were just general actors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they felt like general actors </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that would act in like a TV series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or like a live action movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah, because they have like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have such a good
variation of British accents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, they have like the whole spectrum, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they've chosen it like the
character's given the accent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> based very specifically on like
what it would be in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, where you were born, your wealth, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your socioeconomic background. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It sounds like, it's so stupid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it fits every single character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just insane 'cause I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we can't appreciate, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we can't appreciate
that in the Japanese one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they might get
regional accents on point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> within their own show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes you get like the subtitles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're supposed to be
a bit more like Osaka dialect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or a bit rough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I can't really appreciate that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly I've been appreciating
Japanese voice acting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot more recently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I've actually
started to watch anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without subtitles on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I'm like properly
forced to like listen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, you are like
level 100 weeb right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're at the final
stage before you graduate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The final test. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, I'm like trying to
pick up more of my Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and part of the exercise I've
been putting myself through is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like everything I watch
now, not subtitled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, my enjoyment has
definitely of anime gone down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It helps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It helps so much more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a night and day
watching with subtitles on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and without subtitles on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you don't understand
something that's being said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you, do you go back and
turn the subtitles on then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so normally I watch
anime on Crunchyroll or Netflix. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So Crunchyroll will have the opportunity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to select no subtitles, so
I can select no subtitles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> If there's something that I
really, really want to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what they said, I just rewind
a bit, turn on subtitles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, okay, that's what he said." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then move on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Same thing with Netflix as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, it turns anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to not just like a passive watching thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're just like actively watching- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Study material. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it is study material. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you're gonna have study material, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least have study
material you can enjoy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] True, true, true, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just a different
kind of watching in my eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But since then, I, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember recently I've
been watching "Nagatoro" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without subtitles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I had like my first emotional response </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to watching an anime
without having subtitles on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just, it felt nice
'cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I get what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm getting emotionally invested." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Is this what these
Japanese people feel like?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's exactly what I felt! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Oh, I'm
feeling some stuff now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Is this how the Japanese people feel?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not reading the subtitles
and getting feelings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm actually hearing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually listening to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know how to quite describe it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was a new feeling for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, Garnt, I do the
same thing just with hentai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they don't have
subtitles most of the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I just watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel big brain when
I (speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand most of it actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just feels weird that
I'm doing it with hentai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and not fucking anime! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have actually learned
one word from hentai </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was naka. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember going through
my Japanese classes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like I was like, oh,
so naka means inside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Where have
I heard the term naka?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, inside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, that's where I've heard that before." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a word you'll hear quite often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in many different contexts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the word I've learned from hentai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that I can also use in daily life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can already see the
meme. It's like the fucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Garnt drinking with the fucking coffee, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching anime with no subtitles, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> watching hentai with no subtitles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can already see the meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, yeah, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, the voice acting is
just fucking stellar, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If every voice acting
was like "Castlevania," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we would only be watching dubbed anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you think it played
a massive part to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I assume it's a big part of
it is because it was dubbed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first in English rather than- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 100%, 100%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Rather than dubbed
from Japanese to English. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is there a Japanese dub for it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm pretty sure there must be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never seen it in Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I'll be able to watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you watch the dub,
it's so Goddamn good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's actually a shame to watch
it in any other language. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe this is how Japanese people feel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We don't have a choice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But when we have a choice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why would you, you know, pick
the one that is best, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is definitely one of
those shows where I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not even a competition. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But then obviously it was, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because when I watched season one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, all right, well,
the default is in English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's an English production. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll watch episode one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "If the voice acting is kind of subpar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "then whatever, I'll change it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But, literally first
five minutes, I was like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, English it is then." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fantastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like an anime that is written </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with kind of pretty fucking good American, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I would say it's American writers, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I feel like it's a
lot easier for the actors </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to act the script. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause the dialogue is like
very witty and sarcastic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you hear the dialogue, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it doesn't feel like anime dialogue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so fucking funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very, very witty and like facetious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like, it's so
rare to find an anime dub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where people actually swear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I can count them on one hand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "For fuck's sake." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When someone says fuck
or shit, I'm like, "Oh! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, this dub's going hard." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "We not in Japan anymore." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs)
- I love it, I love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so like hearing it
just like said so naturally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, like talk to any
other Brit or Aussie, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's something that's like
just ingrained into our speech. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you listen to "Trash Taste," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you fucking know that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's great too because
it doesn't feel forced. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because there's a lot of
times where they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we're going to be a little
explicit just to, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like, ooh, edgy and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like in "Castlevania," it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, I can imagine that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> They would totally say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like when you hear it in an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like an anime video game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I remember the most
recent example I can think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of is playing Persona 5 dubbed
and hearing Ryuji say shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, "Ryuji,
wash your mouth, sir!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "You are but a child!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Excuse me!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - When Trevor Belmont's
like, "Oh, for fuck's sake," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, "Oh, that's nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Say it again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Say it again louder." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Say it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so good, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking, like everything
about that I feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even though it gets a lot of good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people say it's very good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it should be
way bigger than it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's genuinely like one
of my favorite animes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've watched in
like the past like year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would agree with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really up there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really, yeah, it's up there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't wait 'til you
watch season four fully. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really need to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're gonna be like,
"All right, okay, hold on." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, for me right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't even feel
like an anime, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's an American
production, obviously, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's kind of like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're about to get into that topic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It feels in the same area as "Avatar." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Avatar," yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I also consider "Avatar" anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, Japanese people
consider it anime, it's anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, who gives a fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did not consider it anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> until I actually watched all of "Avatar" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, okay, I can see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where this argument never ends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're getting into semantics, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's whatever because the
only thing I will say is that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anime or not, it's fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, anime or not, it's fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I don't give a shit if you
think it's an anime or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a fantastic show in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> All I was trying to say is
like, I don't think people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more people in the anime
community are talking about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just 'cause it feels different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let me give you an anecdotal story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was talking to a guy and
I asked him, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, what animes do you like?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he goes, "One anime
that I watched recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "that I really liked," this
is all in Japanese, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I recently watched 'Despicable Me 2.' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "It was one of my favorite
animes of recent." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That completely- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hold up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It made me realign this
whole argument of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is this anime, is this not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, listen, this guy deadass, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this Otaku, self-proclaimed
Otaku just told me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Despicable Me" is a good anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, you know what,
why are we arguing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's a stupid argument as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a clown argument. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> This man just killed the argument. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's literally just like
the west versus the west. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We made this argument out of nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Japanese are like, "We're
not part of this argument." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's that Simpsons picture
where like the people are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> surrounding the two monkeys fighting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the Japanese
watching anime fans argue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> about if this is anime or not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just felt like we were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this is how all religious
fighting started way back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like the 100th century. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> We just made an argument out of nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because yeah, because I mean, fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you ask a Japanese person,
"Monsters Inc," "Shrek," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's all anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just crazy to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause in Japan anime
just means animation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never just had like
fucking, I got hit by a truck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when he said "Despicable Me" was an anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It hit me, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It hit me real. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "This man's
built different saying that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "like deadass." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It would be a different
story if it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "The minions are my waifu." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, that would have been different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why they're
obsessed with minions here! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're obsessed with minions in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fucking everywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, we visited Joey's new
apartment like last week, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and Joey's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Slight detour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, slight detour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It will get back on topic
because he was showing us around, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he shows us into the
last room and he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, do you guys want a free gift? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I was given a free gift
from the moving department. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Do you guys want it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're like, "Sure, Joey, what is it?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Deadass just brings out this
massive minions mini fridge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and expects us to take it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he takes this thing out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're just looking at Joey being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Joey, what do we want to do with this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What are we gonna do with this?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Maybe we can put it in
the Trash Taste studio." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Joey, the
Trash Taste studio isn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "your dumping ground." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I have a gift" is roughly translated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to "I need to get rid of my
trash." (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Please, please take it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I will pay money." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guarantee that's
what they did to Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're all like, "Joey, I
know we're moving all the stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "for you, but here, have a free gift. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Have a minions mini-fridge." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Thank God, we finally
got rid of that shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was despicable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Break time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This episode is sponsored by Vessi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] You're probably
wondering what is Vessi? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I'm glad to answer that question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a comfortable,
stylish, everyday sneaker </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can wear even in winter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the best part about it
is that it's waterproof. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 100% waterproof shoes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And one of the best parts about Vessi is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it is super easy to clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just toss on some water to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or throw it in the washing
machine, and it'll be brand new. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Vessi shoes
are made via Dyma-tex, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a dual climate knit that
keeps you cool in the summer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and warm in the winter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't feel like it
should be waterproof at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And one of the best
things about Vessi is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it just looks like
an everyday sneaker, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you can just wear it every single day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm very lazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and only like to have like
one pair of shoes to wear, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so this is perfect for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Plus Vessi shoes
are sustainably made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with less material
waste, less water waste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and no animal byproducts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, vegans can enjoy these as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also personally and I
know the boys can relate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's rainy season right now in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and having a shoe that's
waterproof is very nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because you don't have to worry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about those Goddamn
massive deceptive puddles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting your shoes and socks wet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nothing is worse than a wet sock. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, if that sounds interesting to you, </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> - Look at these boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Speaking of another anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that has like really unique
voice actors in their cast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you guys excited for "Eden?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I am actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That is like one that I saw
little bits and pieces of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I knew of it because our boy Kev- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Our boy Kevin is doing the soundtrack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - My boy Kevin is doing the soundtrack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shout out to our boy! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now we're just simping, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm pretty excited for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, it's one of those
things that wasn't really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on my radar massively. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just like, I know
Kevin's doing the soundtrack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm probably gonna watch so I can be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Great job, Kevin." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I wasn't excited
until I saw the clips </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we were shown, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is by the time
this podcast comes out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the entire series would
have already been released. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But from the clips that we were shown, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was genuinely like surprised
how excited for this I was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wasn't that excited before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because I didn't really
know what it was about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or how good it was gonna be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All I know were the names
involved and what stood out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me was of course Kevin
doing the soundtrack, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so of course I was
always going to watch it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then the cast list got released, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and people like David Tenant are in it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Neil Patrick Harris. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, what is going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I loved them in "Smurfs." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - My favorite movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it looks really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, the clips we saw as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the animation looked really
fucking good for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, the way they matched the 3D </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with the amazing 2D backgrounds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And again, the music was fucking banging. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know what else to say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of want to just
wait until I watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna get too
hype for it just in case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it looked good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's literally out this week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like it's gonna be
a seven out of 10 for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel, I get that vibe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe, maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It depends because it depends if it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like how it's going to play out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whether it's going to be one long series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it's a four episode series. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So is it going to be only four episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or is it gonna be like kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a movie mini series kind of thing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what I want to know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm hoping it fucks me up, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Makes me very emotional. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I have a feeling they're
gonna play it very safe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's gonna be quite like a safe story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just got that vibe from
the clips we watched. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, we'll see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to be pleasantly surprised. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got the vibes that
I was gonna feel things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> by the end of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the same way I did
in the end of "Monsters Inc." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like that's-
- What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When they finally, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they got rid of Randall, that rascal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they say goodbye to Boo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They say goodbye. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's very emotional. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Monsters Inc." is a great movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was a terrible example. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I cried my eyes out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was just like, if it's
anything like "Monsters Inc." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna be happy as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm only thinking of
great movies right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I was about to say "The Incredibles." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, no, that's fantastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like these are the movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that have just been memed
so much that you forget- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That they're actually bangers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That they're actually
really good movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why is this so hard to
think of subpar movies? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the ending of "Mulan 2." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Straight to DVD. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did not even watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't watched it either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't even know
there was a "Mulan 2." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a "Mulan 2"
straight to DVD movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the point is that I feel like it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> again, I want it to be a
super emotional fucks me up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but I just kinda got the
feeling it looked pretty safe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But again, I hope it does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I will watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just wondering because
it was a Netflix adaptation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was it cast first in English </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or was it dubbed first in
English? 'Cause that's what- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought it was an original story? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have a feeling it might've
been cast first in English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because these are
some big fucking names </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to put behind an anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and you don't normally see these names </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unless it's like a Ghibli movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where Disney is dubbing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, that's what I'm most interested about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause we talked about how, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in which order gets dubbed
really does I feel affects </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how a dub feels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, it depends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> well, what language is
the script written in? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the big question. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you can't really write
two scripts simultaneously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that are like one-to-one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, it's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, especially when it comes
to like English and Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like fundamentally different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, where the sentence
structure's opposite at times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the more I learned Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the more I appreciate what
translators have to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And especially when it comes
to localization the dub. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But at the same time, the
more I understand Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the more I'm just like,
man, this just doesn't give, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I get the localization thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's just sometimes a sentence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just doesn't give me the same feeling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when I'm reading in English
versus hearing it in Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think this is why
when you first start out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as an anime fan, you really
start to get into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You've got this thing where you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "I only want pure 100% translation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "That's all I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "don't you dare change any of
the meanings of the words." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think when you get into it more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you start watching a lot more anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it becomes a bit
tedious to watch anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just kinda want
to watch it dubbed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you kind of start to appreciate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when they just localize
it and they do it well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also the fact that
sometimes there are just some, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, phrases and like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> meanings that just don't translate at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, again, I mean
like one of the best dubs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of all time "Baccano," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there's a lot of sentences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that were just like changed to an extent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's not even
remotely what the guy said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's the same- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It makes sense contextually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the same kind of feeling, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they've instead of
playing it super safe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like, "No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "We think we could improve
this for an English audience." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is a bold thing to do, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we've had a lot of failures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We've had a lot of things
that have gone wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of questionable ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I do really appreciate
when it's done right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I appreciate it more so
than a attempted translation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I feel like the
actors have a way harder time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> delivering Japanese dialogue essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, that's what that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it's really hard to also perform </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> directly translated to Japanese dialogue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make it sound natural in English </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's just some
times where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't sound like
something someone would say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in English, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I especially felt that more when I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause like when I did like
a bit of translation work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during like school and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I like learned linguistics and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, that's where I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I also used to be
like, "How hard could it be? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Just like direct translate it, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "to get the meaning across." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then when I actually started doing it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Oh no, you just can't." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, it's not a matter of like preference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like you physically can't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There were just some Japanese
like ways of saying things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that where you just like, if
I did directly translate it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it would just be a bunch of
words that don't mean anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think, 'cause I don't know if, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even though I spoke two
languages from birth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always thought as languages as like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're all just the same thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just said in different ways. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But then like if that makes sense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where everything can be
one-to-one translated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, I get what you mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every meaning can be
expressed in another language. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think 'cause we've been
spoiled 'cause things have been, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> our whole life we've just had things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that have been translated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So we've never known what
the other side is like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's English, it's
been translated for us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And even again, even though
I spoke two languages, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I could never wrap my
head around this concept </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until I started learning Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I was like, oh, it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like another planet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it hasn't even touched anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how to
describe this like mental- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so hard to describe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for someone who only speaks one language. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I remember the first
time I noticed this was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was watching a Thai film with Sydney, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I, you know, she obviously
had English subtitles on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and as someone who speaks both
Thai and can read English, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was really distracting; </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one, because it felt like
I was hearing something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and seeing something and they
both meant the same thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they felt different for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's this language dissonance
that I can't quite describe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's something that I
feel like having now trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to learn the language that, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part of a culture and part
of like an entire country's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, way of thinking
and culture is just ingrained </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into a language. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just so much deeper than just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I say one thing, it means another thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I would say that depending
on what language I speak, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my personality kind of shifts as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's a different
kind of way of thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're speaking another language. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so hard to describe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for anyone who only speaks one language, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but anyone who does
speak two languages will </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably understand that you probably have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a slightly different personality
speaking one language </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to another. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I apparently have a
completely different personality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when I speak Japanese compared to English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're a lot softer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you're a lot softer.
- What in English or Japanese? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Japanese.
- Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I always thought it was the opposite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's just surface level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like I also realized as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause, you know, sometimes
you're in class or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're asking, "Oh, how do
I say this in Japanese?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, no, you can't say that Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't exist in Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not a concept. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They've never thought of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, oh God, you just fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like flashback to me in school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone being like, "How do
you say fuck in Japanese?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, how do I explain
that doesn't exist? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I realized
because Welsh and English, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because although they are
entirely different languages, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone thinks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, well Welsh is just
another version of English." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like completely different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's, you know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you're in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're in the same country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, German is closer
to English than Welsh is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's the reason why I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that I never had this
realization before was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's the culture
that you grew up in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the countries
have a similar culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> now at least in the modern day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The concepts do sort of translate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because we've made them translate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, we've made the concept felt by both. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There isn't like the cultural gap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because the cultural
gap is like inherently, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's just sayings and stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that will never, ever have a meaning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no matter how much you
try and translate them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's just an inherent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a feeling. And it's a, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is just a weird concept
that we're going down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it seems so obvious- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - None of us are linguists. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> This is all just our thoughts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from learning a different language </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and from speaking multiple languages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think the best thought
experiment I can think of is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like anyone who speaks English, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like how would you explain
the concept of the word fuck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to someone who doesn't speak English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and somebody who didn't grow up here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like, it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even know where I
would begin to start, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, if you don't know, like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you didn't grow up in the culture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you didn't grow up with
people saying it around you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> hearing that word
everywhere, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how do I explain the right
way to use the word fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I literally made a video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they made an entire textbook purely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for the word fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I've seen this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a 70 page textbook </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that goes through all the
different ways you can use fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, I thought it was a
gag at first when I bought it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then when I actually
started reading, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, that's how you explain it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Apparently there is a way to explain it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just takes 70 pages. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the fact that it takes 70 pages </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just shows how complicated it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though for us it's just second nature </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just makes sense, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like the opposite can be said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like Japanese to English, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, how do you explain
to an English speaker </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what (speaks Japanese) means? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like it's a purely cultural thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, it makes
complete sense in Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then every time,
like every time in anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they say like (speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There's always a different
way that someone's translated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a different way to translate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> depending on the context of the scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or the context of what he's saying it in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, saying, I guess so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, oh, I guess so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like it's not a thing in Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can't translate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not even even in Welsh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's such an English thing that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause none of the words mean
what they mean altogether. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a weird concept that we just make up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We do that with a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I find that shit fascinating, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bussin'. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, bussin'. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bussin'. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The fuck is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I literally just
learned that word today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Man, I couldn't even keep
up with my own language. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How the fuck are Japanese people meant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to keep up with my language? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But going back to anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, going back to anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I appreciate voice acting so much more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched like two episodes of "Yasuke." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The voice acting I really enjoyed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to watch that as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - From two episodes, I wasn't
really sold on the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, I knew about the, if
you don't know about "Yasuke," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the plot is essentially Nobunaga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way back in the Oda period had- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sengoku period. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sengoku period, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sengoku period had just
met a black guy at a market </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and was like, "I want
him to fight for me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Based on a real person as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was one of his closest
like allies, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the story kind of expands on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I saw a bunch of this on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought this would be
a fucking badass anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Shit you not like two
weeks later got announced. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wow, I guess I should
start wishing for things." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I highly encourage you
to go read up about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's super interesting and
you wouldn't expect it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also done by LeSean Thomas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, done by LeSean Thomas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know who the
animation studio is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - MAPPA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, is it MAPPA? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I do think that
if you want to learn, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is not like the best of explaining, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> at least from the first
two episodes, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is wildly different from-" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You said there was like magic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's magic, there's mechs and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm pretty sure that
didn't exist in feudal Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well yeah, I mean- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was literally LeSean
Thomas going, "fuck it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get it, you're an anime- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Throw everything in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go crazy with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But in some aspects I'm also like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this is such a fucking
badass story by itself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it doesn't need anything added. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so Goddamn, like
the best parts of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again I've only watched two out of six, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the best parts of the first two episodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where the parts were like pre, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there's a time skip, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pre-time skip where there's
like no magic or shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where he's just fighting sword to sword. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Man to man combat, it's so Goddamn good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the story and it builds on all the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously back then there'd
be a lot of issues with race. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They weren't too happy about
it when Nobunaga was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is my best friend." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, and building on
that was so interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought like the best
parts of the anime were that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And again, yeah, the
story is just so cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, go read up about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's tons of YouTube videos about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually like went and
like fucking researched. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The real life Yasuke just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause like I had no fucking idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a badass story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, it's fucking badass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like it's so bizarre
that it could be fictional. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you feel like the mech
and magic aspects added </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to that story or do you
think it felt out of place? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me personally I
didn't really enjoy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I was hoping- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just wanted- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The story of Yasuke,
that's what I wanted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You wanted like a "Samurai
Champloo" style like story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kind of, I mean, but then again, like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that historically accurate? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Breakdancing samurai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There weren't magic and mechs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The music in the first two episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The voice acting, top fucking notch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even the Japanese is really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, you know, even in the Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yasuke is played by a black Japanese guy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is insane to see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] That's awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's normally not on the priority list. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, it's really
cool seeing that, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why wouldn't you want that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I mean, everything
else about it, I was digging. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I haven't really been motivated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to watch the rest of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think that's 'cause the
mechs thing's kinda put me off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and the magic and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, the short clips
I watched of it was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like I didn't realize it was like gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that fucking bloody and gory as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, dude, it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, some of the
scenes like reminded me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of like a 90s OVA, like
"Ninja Scroll" level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Feels like "Kill Bill" at some points. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was like "Kill
Bill," "Ninja Scroll" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like levels of like, ooh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ooh, that's brutal! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I still haven't seen it, but I- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Check it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will, I will definitely check it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'll know if it's for you
in the first two episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because like I really like
LeSean Thomas' work anyway, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I was gonna watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just hard to find time
with all the fucking anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the season and everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which you two don't know about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can't relate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've been meaning to watch a bunch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been meaning to watch "86." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "86" is actually really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I probably say that's my favorite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I can't say favorite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's definitely top three
of my favorite anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out this season right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it just feels good to
have an original mecha show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just gives me the same feeling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as like some of the OG mecha shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that made me really,
really like the genre. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it feels like it's been so long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since we've just had a
non-Gundam, non-Code Geass, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or non-big franchise mecha show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has actually been
really, really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because most of the mecha shows I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been coming out
recently have either been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like "Darling in the
Franxx" where I get invested </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it kind of does shit that falls flat, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or like I've really enjoyed- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then triggers like let me introduce. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you've had
things like "SSSS Gridman" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which fucking amazing show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like, it's a mecha show, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's also a bit tokusatsu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it's not like, it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not like a vanilla
mecha show, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Vanilla. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Vanilla mecha where it's
just mecha and that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But "86," you know,
gives me the same feelings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of when I first watched "Code Geass" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the mechs that I
watched in the mid-2000s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that really made me
love the fucking genre. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's still early days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if it's
gonna be like 24 episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or 12 episodes where there's
gonna be a complete story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm really hoping so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's just really, really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, do you know
the story of it at all? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't want to know anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All I've heard that it's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm gonna watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just go into it blind
is the best way I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I watched "The Way of the
Husband" on Netflix as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "The Way of the Househusband." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's it, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I enjoyed it a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was very funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't had an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that made me laugh out loud constantly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - For like two hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I thought it was gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 episodes, 24 minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's like five episodes
of like 12, 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I only saw three episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I got the rest
of the season to binge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know it was only five episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's five episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It kinda sucked that it literally
just like, it just ended. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like, there's the last skit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bye bye. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it was like, there
was no ending or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It wasn't like, "See ya
next time" or anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just like, "Okay, skit over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Go the fuck home, get outta here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause each of the chapters
in the manga are really, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really short, like maybe like
five, six pages like max. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought the pacing was fantastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I knew obviously it caused
a lot of controversy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with the animation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I saw a lot of people
complaining on Twitter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't decide. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I flip-flopped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There was some sketches where
I felt they did really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was some where I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Holy fuck, this was so lazily done." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it depended on the sketch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I think it just went
down to the classification </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I think we've
briefly talked about this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on "Trash Taste After Dark"
where like my opinion of it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's not so much an
anime in the traditional sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's basically just a motion comic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It is just a motion- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wish it was labeled
that and advertised as that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead of anime adaptation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I feel if you've labeled it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as "motion comic adaptation," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> then I think less people would
have been interested in it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - True, but then also
you set this expectation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that this is gonna be a
thing that might happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I feel like it was that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it being on Netflix as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Netflix really picking this up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> which gave it like people
preconceived expectations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause to me, I watched it, I
thought it was funny as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought the animation
worked for some of the jokes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Again, like, it's up there with, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought it was just as funny
as like "Sakamoto" for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if not funnier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it was so Goddamn funny, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it scratched that itch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I didn't know I was longing for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every single episode
I was fucking cackling, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> laughing out loud alone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like that weird
like surrealist comedy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just don't know
what he's gonna say next, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's gonna happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every time you feel like you
figured out how absurd he is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he just does something else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, this is fucking funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If you haven't watched
it, please go watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just about like a Yakuza
member who gets married </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and straightens out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and has become a housewife, househusband. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, it's just really funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it would have been at like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it would have been a
nine or a 10 for me if, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again, like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really like the add
of the motion comic style. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you think it would have been funnier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with say just mediocre adaptation? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mediocre animation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Genuinely, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause there was so
little animation on anyway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's just times I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish they just did a little bit on this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to help sell the joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like the lack of
animation helps sell some jokes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I agree, I agree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just some of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because some of it
just looks ridiculous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And that to me just made it more funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But imagine this anime
in like "Nichijou" style. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but like name another comedy anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's on "Nichijou" level. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - There isn't, but I'm just saying like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you had the choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, if I had the choice between that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd always go for fucking
"Nichijou" animation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even like "KonoSuba" animation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause "KonoSuba," I think a
lot of people underestimate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> how good the character
animation in "KonoSuba" is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That really sold so much of
the voice acting performance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where a lot of other comedy
anime I feel have fallen flat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you have amazing
voice acting performance, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have amazing source material, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the animation is just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The most okay animation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It really does nothing to
enhance the source material. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe I'm being too
hard on it. I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I was just shocked
at how little there was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Whereas with "Way of the Househusband," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it had amazing voice acting obviously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had amazing source material, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I feel like because they didn't try, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it kind of like suited that
comedy style perfectly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you couldn't have amazing animation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would have preferred to
have it have like just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not even like bad animation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like a very unique
style of limited animation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that really helps sell some of the weirder </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and more ridiculous parts of the manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it is a ridiculous manga, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I feel like the animation
style helped accentuate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the ridiculous moments to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there's some
moments where I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, okay, this joke
works with this animation." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's others where I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This really needed more to
help sell some of this joke." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, personally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like maybe a mix could have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like really, really propelled it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you seen clips of the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a Japanese live action adaptation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you seen this?
- [Garnt] I have not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've seen it, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so bad! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so funny! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's tragic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, what's that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Describe it to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like, okay, the main guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it looks like a cosplay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't look- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is a cosplay! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, it looks like a cosplay,
not like an actual actor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, the guy isn't like built enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is like "Full Metal
Alchemist" live action level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then his friend in the anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who was really young and supposed to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the young gang member
looks really fucking old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't watch it like fully. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I only watched like
clips of it on YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was just like, "Oh no." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched the same skit,
both of them and compared. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The humor wasn't nearly as
good in the live action. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like they didn't like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause with animation you
can really sell the absurdity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the live action one- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the point, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but it didn't work very well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I feel like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also Japanese acting in TV shows, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how they are so bad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I've never seen
Japanese acting in a TV show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and been like, "That's fantastic." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unless it's like Ken Watanabe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally, it's like he's the only one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel bad saying that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I feel like that's
such a broad statement, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've watched so much Japanese TV </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all the drama acting is appalling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's not good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Especially in like the live action. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, especially when a
live action anime adaptation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of a Japanese TV show or a Japanese anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's always, it's so weird
seeing live action actors try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to act like anime characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or doing like the anime style acting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you watch like Korean dramas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Korean adaptations and
stuff, and it's so much better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I watched like "Sweet Home," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the web tune adaptation into Netflix, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the actors were fucking amazing in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a live action adaptation? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Live action.
- Oh shit, I gotta watch that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the acting was really fucking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, every single time
I've watched a Korean movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or Korean drama, I'm always so impressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at how fucking good, not to
say that the actors are bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I just thought for
some reason, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I've seen Japanese acting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's gonna be over the
top dramatic all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like, especially in recent years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Korean movies and Korean dramas
and shows have just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they are way ahead of like
Japanese J dramas and J movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So many movies where I'm like
fucking compared to English, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it like shits on them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, some of the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like "Old Boy," like I love that movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fucking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's actually based
on a manga, did you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, "Old Boy" was originally a manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It got adapted into a Korean movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that's cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That movie is like one
of my favorite movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The acting is so Goddamn
good in that movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The cinematography is fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's one of the greatest
foreign films of all time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's, you know, it's up
there with like "Parasite" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as like, to me, as one of the
best Korean movies I've seen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> There are so many good
Korean movies, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like people
are now just figuring out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that man, Koreans make good movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, they're very good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Train to Busan" as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's a fantastic movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember first time
watching "Train to Busan" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "I've seen zombie movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I know how this works." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And for some reason it didn't do like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like, you know, on paper, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't do that much different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to every other zombie movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's just so fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't pinpoint why it was so good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know what it is,
like when I watch Japanese TV, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like it's like a pantomime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It does feel like that level
of acting where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Is there somebody behind me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I better not look." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, "Whoa!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like with Japanese acting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very reminiscent
to anime, anime acting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which anime acting works for anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but it doesn't work for
live action acting at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, well I was asking
some friends, I'm like, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I was watching with them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Are they famous? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Are they famous?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "Oh yeah,
they're a famous voice actor." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, when you're
a famous voice actor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can get roles in TV shows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's kind of strange </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's normally the other way around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with, you know, western stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just odd to think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I feel like as someone
who does voice acting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it does not translate to the IRL acting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a completely different skillset. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, you understand
the fundamentals of acting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know, can you hit the mark? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, you're not
being told how to walk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're not being told
how to act physically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what you do have to learn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That is separate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a lot you don't think about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wonder why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I sit there and I'm just confused. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, why is Japanese acting
like generally not as good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not saying that there's
zero Japanese good actors, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just saying in general
the TV production is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty lackluster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think maybe it's because
like they don't really think of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like outside of Japan movie industry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as much of a competition. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, they might think it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know, with like,
you know, Hollywood films, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like English speaking films, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, you're not only
competing with Hollywood, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you're competing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with literally every other
English speaking country, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every other English speaking production. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas I feel the Japanese
film industry is kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in its own bubble. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're kind of just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No driving force. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no like driving
force or like threat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to make them be like, "We
gotta step up our game." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or like, or maybe the fact that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're probably like just unaware. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They probably just think
like, "Well, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "English speaking productions
and like other productions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "that aren't Japanese do this in this way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "but for us, this works
with our type of audience." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So, there's no like they
probably don't even think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is bad acting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm sure people are
gonna comment and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "There are so many good Japanese films." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - There are a lot of good Japanese films. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's a lot rarer to find a
really, really good Japanese- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They come few and far in between. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially in like J dramas, I feel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - J dramas is even harder. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Holy fuck, that's what I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's where you really see the pinnacle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like the right
way to describe J dramas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> from like the majority I've watched is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just they are very campy.
- Yeah, that's what I mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's pantomime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything is fucking over the top. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so campy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, you know, there's
an audience for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's like a, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's, you know, I
do enjoy some J dramas, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's less of, "I
think this is a good show" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and more just like, "I can
just get behind this show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You know, I like whatever
source material it's adapting." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And also I don't, frankly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't give a fuck about cinematography. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really care too much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not very picky, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that's good because J
drama has zero cinematography. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - J dramas they shoot it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a fucking daytime TV commercial. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why does it look like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I never thought I
would give a shit about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until I watched J drama. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't give a about cinematography </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until you see something
that has no cinematography. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, what are you gonna
fucking advertise to me a plunger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that has four and one any second now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Waiting for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause of how it's shot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's ridiculous. I don't
know why it looks like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I feel like I've
seen some YouTube videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with better cinematography than
some of the stuff out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in J dramas right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Broaden in Japan channels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 100%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That'll make up for the
lack of his signature. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I hate shitting on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I don't really understand why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really know if they care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really know if
there's a want to improve. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just don't think
the audience is there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, the audience doesn't give a shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, it's normal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, the majority of the
population here is older. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So generally- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be fair, I have
seen a bunch of J dramas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where the cinematography is absolute ass, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I've still enjoyed it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the story was just
genuinely really, really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it wasn't until like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like an afterthought of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh yeah, that was a good J drama." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the cinematography was shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I saw this one and it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was like a James Bond show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like, this Japanese guy looked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Japanese George Clooney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was really cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "Holy shit, this guy's hot." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I know who you're
talking about actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, he looks kind of western. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He looks western, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I looked it up and he's 100% Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But he looks like George
Clooney if he was Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I know who you're talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know his name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he was just like a
no nonsense attitude guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, "I'm coming
to get the information." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And just like beat this guy up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> With terrible lighting and cinematography. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was like, really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why I'm talking about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just fascinated by him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like that man's so Goddamn hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Good for him. I wish I was that hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I've always 'cause
I've had the movie experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of, "Wow, this movie has fucking
fantastic cinematography. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Unfortunately the rest
of the movie is shit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What was that movie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was the something
still water or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was originally supposed
to be the Bioshock movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but then they like changed
it halfway through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do not know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have no idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you want to-
- Yeah, let me look it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know exactly what it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like the movie had like the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like amazing fucking cinematography. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It looked fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it was stylized perfectly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really creepy cinematography. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "A Cure For Wellness." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I haven't seen that movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that's a horror movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the horror movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "A Cure For Wellness." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was apparently, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was originally supposed
to be the Bioshock movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And you can tell- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Looks nothing like Bioshock. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, obviously they like
completely changed the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That threw me off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when you said it's meant
to be the Bioshock movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Supposedly it was supposed
to be the Bioshock movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then something happened legality wise, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, time to rewrite
the story completely." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like when you just
look at the cinematography </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like the sets and
stuff like that, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, I can kind of see
what they were going for." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, this looks cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's very stylized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cinematography is great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Unfortunately, the story was like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, what the fuck is happening? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nothing makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Characters were all shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, like that's when I got
to the point, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would I have preferred this movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it had shit cinematography
but a good story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> versus great cinematography
but a shit story? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And this is like the
animation versus story debate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that anime fans go through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, which do you prefer? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If you had to choose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Story, story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it has to be well acted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't sell me on a bad
story with not with actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who don't sell the moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "The Room" is pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "The Room" is pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A unique exception. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's called brilliant acting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what you're
talking about. (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What a top grade actor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like, I feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess watching a lot
of J dramas reminds me of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like the old Thai soap operas
I would see my mom watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, what
the fuck is this, Mom? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, what the hell are you watching? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the Indian shows as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like that's
just a genre of itself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you got like the campiest, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most melodrama shit going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't know what's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You see out of context clips. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think even some Korean
dramas do this as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just not as well known. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I remember seeing one clip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it was a Korean drama and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The one where he's
falling down the stairs? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, that's the Bollywood one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's the Bollywood one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The one I was thinking
of where this woman, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this guy says something and
this woman takes this entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like fucking cabbage of kimchi
and just slaps this guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just like, I just want to
know the context of this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause out of context
it just makes no sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We just have to remind our audience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that this is a Korean production. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Bring out the kimchi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Didn't like, didn't Pewdiepie react </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like a Bollywood clip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there was like
drama or something about it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, they like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was it?
- I swear there was drama. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if I'm
remembering this incorrectly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like there was like
a clip that he reacted to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was 'cause there
was like a reaction image </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where she was like (gasps) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it was like 20
shots of like zooming in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's the woman falling off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like the balustrade, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that what it is?
- Oh, I've seen that one! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the guy's like slow
motion trying to catch him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's like going back and forth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like this woman's been
in the air for five minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a second floor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This woman's like
literally fucking airbending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right in front of my eyes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone's just like
watching it in slow motion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I swear he got into some spat
or something because of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You keep talking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I would love to
react to Indian soap operas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> out of context. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like there's
every other soap opera, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there's just Indian soap opera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They take campiness to the next
level, and it's so amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you ever seen like
many Bollywood movies? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was a period in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where I tried to get
into Bollywood movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the problem is is that
there are so many fucking films </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in the Bollywood like scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I didn't realize
how many movies they made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, they make
like fucking five, 10 times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as much as like Hollywood. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I'm just like, I
legitimately was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the fuck do I even begin? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like I don't know anybody else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who like has stepped into that territory. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so like my only other
option was to like go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> on the internet and be like,
"best Bollywood movies." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Top 10 Bollywood films of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank you, Watch Mojo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's my watch list right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then every fucking like
top 10, top 50 list I saw was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just like all completely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there wasn't a single like
entry where it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, I saw that on this page." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all fucking different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, what do I just have to like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Number one, "Slumdog Millionaire." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do I literally just have to like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a great movie though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not Bollywood. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember when that came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> people were like yeah, I like Bollywood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Slumdog Millionaire." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's good, it's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so I'm like, do I just
have to like bite the bullet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just like pick a random one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just like hope that it's a good movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Please let us know in the comments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What's a good Bollywood film? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The only one I can
remember that I watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I think is really good is
a film called "Three Idiots." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the only reason I watched it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was on the
IMDb top 100 at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "What is this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's a concept I feel like
that was made for Indians. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's a film, get
this, about engineers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was like actual, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember if they
were all mechanical engineers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or electrical engineers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were engineers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was just so weird
seeing this engineering movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then out of nowhere they
just break out into song </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and dance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's nothing I hate
more than fucking musicals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I cannot stand- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't like musicals? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate musicals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually agree with Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, if I want a musical, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll fucking pause the
movie and go on Spotify </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and play Daft Punk four minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't get in the way, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate musicals so Goddamn much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I cannot, I would rather do anything else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, I'm very hit
or miss with musicals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, a lot of musicals I'm
just like fucking whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then if you like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I could watch like
"Rocky Horror" like 30 times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like to me
musical works well on like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when it's a stage, you know, when it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you're watching it live, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a really, really amazing experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I remember watching
"Les Miserables." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure I fucking butchered that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Less Miserables. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Les Miserables. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember watching that
in England at the West End. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Fucking amazing experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I remember watching the movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like,
"This is really boring." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I watched it for the first
time like pretty recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just 'cause Aki was like,
"Oh, you have to watch it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "It's great." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, okay, well, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I always give musicals
a go, so it's whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This might be the rare time where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like "Rocky Horror" where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh I might fucking fall in love with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, Goddamn,
they haven't stopped singing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for like two hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just feels like a
fucking quick time event. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, when you're in a musical. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "I guess I'll press X. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Fuck, I'll press X." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just feels like it doesn't fucking end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like unskippable cutscenes and shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, get this shit outta here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, what I like about like
"Rocky Horror" for instance, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that like; one, it's fucking weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> two, it's fucking Tim
Curry in like leggings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just like
amazing just conceptually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like what I like about "Rocky Horror" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to like say like
"Les Miserables" is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Les Miserables" is just like 90% singing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then 10% dialogue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas "Rocky Horror" is like 50/50. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it's like you get the
enjoyment of like an actual movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like type of story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and every now and then
it goes into like song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But when I'm watching
a musical, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just get to the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why am I here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't care about the song and dance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Just get to the story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Give me the story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The only time I actually
think I liked a musical was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Little Shop of Horrors" right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That has like a lot of music in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The one with the big plant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a musical, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I think I liked that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it made the
thing fucking terrifying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it started singing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It sold me on the horror </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause when this giant plant
puppet started singing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as like a 15-year-old kid
I was like, "Holy shit!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the kind of
like jazzy style, like yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was terrifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you ever watch
"Bugsy Malone" as a kid? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Bugsy Malone." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know the name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know anything about it though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's, I can't remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I only have vivid
memories of watching as a kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All I know it was like, it's
like set in like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the prohibition era. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's about a bunch of
people running speakeasies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But for some reason,
everyone of the gangsters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are, you know, who are in this movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's played by kids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when they have Tommy guns,
instead of firing bullets, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they fire like a cream pie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, whenever someone gets hit
by a cream pie in the face, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, thinking back as a
kid, it's the most like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the weirdest fever
dream I'm describing right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But it exists! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This sounds like a David
Lynch film, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like that weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sounds like on the same level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as what are those fucking dogs called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The movies where they
just like dub over dogs? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was literally like
Air Buddy or some shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a whole fucking series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like "Snow Dogs." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, that level. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sounds like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where they just fucking
dub over dogs doing shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've been trying to find
someone else in my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who also has this vivid memory
of watching "Bugsy Malone" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as a kid 'cause I just want
to reconfirm that it's real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That this was real! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It really happened! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just need to know, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So far I've, you know, maybe
it was just my school thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe it was my generation thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I have not met a
single other person IRL </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who remembers watching "Bugsy Malone." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, please comment section, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if there's someone in the
comments section who knows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who has watched "Bugsy
Malone" before, please, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please tell me 'cause I need
to know I'm not fucking crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to know this wasn't a fever dream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to know if this really happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone in the comments,
just be like, "I have no idea." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a musical so- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a musical as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No.
- That's why I remember it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a musical. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Real question though, did you
guys watch the "Cats" movie? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I didn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I saw half. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why did you watch it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I was just like, 'cause I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who doesn't look at
that trailer and think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This looks like shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm gonna watch it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, you know when
you just see ads so often </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for something that you've decided </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna dislike this
thing before you see anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was me with "Cats"
'cause it was just everywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was so obnoxious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they do that thing with like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This has never been done before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This has literally
never been done before." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, they just say that about anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "We've never had this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "We've never experienced this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "We all felt amazing on the set." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The thing is with "Cats"
is that I've seen it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on stage before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, I actually thought,
not my favorite musical, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out of all the musicals
I've seen on stage, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's pretty all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty decent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it's a good story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The songs are pretty all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then when you watch that trailer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you see the horrific
things in that trailer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like, "Well, you
have piqued my interest now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking green screen like huge artists, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like on these like fucking cat like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically these huge actors being furries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I swear there was like really
funny, like cast interviews. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where like the cast were
like, "I don't fucking know." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "What do you want me to say?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I love it when actors like give interviews </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they just fucking
shit on what they're in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> There's something really
cathartic about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And like they're like, "Yeah, it sucks." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, the fucking Robert Patterson one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the Robert Patterson one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I can't fucking stand Twilight." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, Robert Patterson please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have we spoke about this
before on the podcast? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we were talking
about it before in private. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Robert Patterson hated
being in "Twilight" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and his interviews about
it are so fucking funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Daniel Craig in James Bond. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did we talk about this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally can't remember
if we talked about this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apologies if we said it already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We must've spoke
about it on set I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Daniel Craig hates being
in 007, in "James Bond." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The interviews that he
gave were so fucking funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> He did like a quote where he said like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'd rather cut myself
than do another Bond film." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he did another Bond film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so tragic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like imagine
getting hired back again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by the people you're just shitting on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I would rather die than
work for you again." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they're like,
"Let's get him back on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Let's get this guy back." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, how out of options must they be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to have to like bring
Daniel Craig back in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They must have thrown so much money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I'm pretty sure
he must've signed a contract </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> before otherwise it's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause you know,
if you break contract, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure that you're
just like blacklisted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from Hollywood, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that's why like no
one really breaks contracts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Either that or they must
have given Daniel Craig </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a fat fucking paycheck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure they gave him a lot of money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm pretty sure they
gave him a lot of money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Didn't they have to do
something 'cause he like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the, which movie was it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What was the most recent film? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The one after "Skyfall" right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the one after "Skyfall." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was one after "Skyfall?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - God, I'm so behind on my Bond movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, there was one where in the casino, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a casino scene, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where he like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was about to say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Spectre." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Type in Daniel Craig gloves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was a thing where
they had to like CGI </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think gloves on or off of him
because he just left them on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he liked them or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah, he bought gloves
before like filming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he really wanted to wear them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so they had to like
CGI the gloves off of him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because he wanted to wear them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can you Google it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was so fucking done with this shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that he impulse bought
gloves and was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm wearing them on the
film. I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And they had to CGI them off of him! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - CGI artists like cracking
their necks being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I couldn't do that just
out of feeling horrible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the people who have
to work on that CGI. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you've got to respect the level of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't give a fuck." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just a new level of just,
yeah, don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the most passive
aggressive way of being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Don't call me back, please." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're literally on like a
half a billion dollar movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just don't give a fuck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about wearing your like $2,200 gloves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, "Ah, who cares?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also just like the
choice of gloves as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of all things you could have put on is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like the biggest fuck you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just, I don't know what about it- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just so cathartic
to just hear this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so funny just hearing
individuals be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Fuck you, big movie corporation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm going to do what I want." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they just roll with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, "I guess
we'll fix it in post?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I guess we can't get him
to take his gloves off?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Skyfall" yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he's in the new one as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think the new one is
supposedly his last one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it got delayed because of COVID. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm pretty sure that's what they said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about "Skyfall" as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They said that about
like the last three films. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But they don't know
who's gonna replace him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember a time like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like the late 90s,
early 2000s where like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel every "James Bond" movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a different James Bond. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, they did like two or
three I think each at least. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like they were
like replacing them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like quicker than Daniel Craig, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I mean- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pierce Brosnan did a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pierce Brosnan did five maybe? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But he probably also enjoyed
it unlike Daniel Craig. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think he got his
paycheck and he yeeted out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think he got what he got. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What else has Daniel Craig done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apart from "James Bond" recently? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's done a few pretty good films. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember any
off the top of my head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He did, like, I really liked
him in like "Layer Cake." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Layer Cake!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was a really British film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've completely forgot about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like him in everything
else but "James Bond." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think he's really good in
everything but "James Bond." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but I feel like in "Layer Cake," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he also just played Daniel Craig, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But he played it better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He just kind of played James
Bond in a different skin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, it was... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Kind of very felt James Bond. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was Daniel Craig playing James Bond </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playing Daniel Craig. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like James Bond is
just an outdated archetype. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like it is as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You watch it nowadays and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they've tried their best to kind of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Modernize it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it still feels like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when they're trying to put
like the Playboy scenes in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, this is
kind of cringe nowadays. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why, but
just seeing a guy just go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yes, I'm going to fuck these two women." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, all right, okay, sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We get it, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You get pussy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What did you match them on Tinder? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't have to brag about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just felt very like nowadays, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it just feels like, oh,
this feels kind of lame. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, it's a
very dated archetype. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I can't imagine anyone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like imagine if I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "My name is Maneetapho. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Garnt, Maneetapho." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's you with the outfit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The glasses, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're wearing the turtleneck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, that's why I really
enjoyed "Kingsman," right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "The names Job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Steve Handjobs." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Steve Handjobs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Kingsman" was good
until the second movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. That's why I
really liked the first movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because it completely just
like almost made fun of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I really liked it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it became the archetype. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then it became the
archetype, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> How the fuck did we get
on about James Bond films? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't fucking, we were
talking about musicals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, have you ever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was thinking about- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're really good at tangents today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was thinking about
musicals I actually like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The only ones I probably
actually like were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the "South Park Movie." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that is a musical, isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you guys ever see
"The Book of Mormon" live? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's literally been the one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the musical that I've
always wanted to watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a fucking amazing musical. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And the reason I like those
musicals is the music is funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it plays off the joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it doesn't like, I
don't care about the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Me no think, me laugh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't care about
the story of South Park, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm there for the jokes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that helps add onto the jokes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's why it's the only
musical I can get behind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, I'm not really
that much of a Broadway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or West End guy, so I've only seen- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought you were. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You seem like a Broadway
kind of gentleman. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Stop you from singing, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do I seem like a theater kid to you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever been tempted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go watch like the anime like musicals? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you seen any of them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tempted, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They restarted the
"Death Note" one, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How does that work? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've been so tempted to
go and watch it just to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I went to go see a "Death Note" musical. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Or like the "Prince of Tennis" musical. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really wanna go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That idea wasn't in my head,
but now it is in my head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've been trying to find
people to come with me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to go watch like any of the anime musicals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because there's
something like defeatist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, so I went to go
watch the Death Note musical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "by myself the other day." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, as you do on a Sunday. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, I'd fucking do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll go by myself to watch
the "Death Note" musical. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They had the "My Hero Academia" musical, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't they as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they did! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They did! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That idea wasn't in my head, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but now I'm just genuinely curious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> How does that work? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you adapt "Death
Note" to a musical? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ♪ I like eating apples ♪ </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ♪ Die, die, die ♪ </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like you'd have to be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I want it to be in the style
of like Willy Wonka-esque </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like original, you know,
like the Oompa Loompa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just have Ryuk be an Oompa Loompa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have that kind of sing a song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shinigami's just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd like to think that the costume </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for Ryuk is extremely poor as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just the shittest costume. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just a guy in like a gimp costume. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's just been like
tarred and feathered. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's just kind of like
overweight and he's like, "No." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Smoker's voice as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Give me an apple and a cigarette. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just fucking William
Defoe without any makeup on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just William Defoe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just comes out like, "It is me, Ryuk." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs)
- I'd buy it, I'd buy it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's very good actor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He could do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If anyone could just stand
there and make me accept it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's probably William Defoe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just remembering the "Death Note" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> live action movie now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was the best part of the movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was the best part of the movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He said four lines and
that was it, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But he was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was good in those four lines. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How'd we get onto this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How did we tangent?
- I don't know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We're good at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So gentlemen, moving on though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is now our last few
moments in the studio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the last episode of season one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that what we're gonna call it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know if we're doing
like season one via studios </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or via the year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, either way,
this is the end, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause we're like right on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as we're recording, this is
like one year anniversary </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - 53, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Close enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 52 weeks in a year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the one over here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it felt a lot longer
than a year to be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't remember the studio
being this full, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't remember what
it looked like before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's scary going back
to like episode one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And being like, it doesn't
look like the same room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll tell you what, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after you mentioned it on
the Trash Taste Awards, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember looking at the
first episode again as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I forgot that we
originally had our camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the way back there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right in the back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, it kind of looked
like you're peeking through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, you know, like you're
peeking through being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, what are they getting on to?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now it just feels like way too close. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hello. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This is the new camera angle
that we changed to, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What, like 30 episodes ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it just feels weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I forgot that we changed camera angles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the different
feeling that it gave off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, like I'm impressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> how many guests we got this year as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Given the limited circumstances of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All nine of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Except for Chris. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck Chris. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I'm sure Chris will be on again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure Chris is gonna
come knocking on the door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is he gonna be the first
guest on in season two as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - He said he wants to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just asserting dominance
to every other guest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't see why not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Deadass what else is there
to talk about with Chris? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What'd you mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just have Chris on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's insanity in shoes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Chris just makes funny
moments by being on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We bully Chris. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Chris bullies us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, it's a good deal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm looking forward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to what drip he's gonna
be wearing next off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after winning laziest drip in season one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, like after
that episode goes off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's gonna be like, "Oh,
I gotta come with a suit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I told Chris, I was like,
"You won an award by the way." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Won two awards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "You won an award." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Oh really?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Just one?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Fuck off, Chris!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lucky for you, Chris. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't tell him about the second one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So, he'll be surprised. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Brilliant, brilliant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He won't find out until- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, he won't find
that out until that's up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, but I guess by the
time you see us next week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll be in a hopefully brand new set up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah, it'll be
like a month for us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It'll be one week for you guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - A week for you guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We want to remodel and
change the setup a little bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Get the angles different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're not gonna have like
a completely different setup </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right off the bat I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's gonna be similar to season one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where we kind of grow our
set as the season goes on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, I feel, I like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We haven't decided everything yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have no idea what the
new set is gonna look like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to get all new figures. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what I want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That involves having
another Akihabara special, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is gonna be pretty
hard right now, considering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything is locked down.
- Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But in future. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So maybe you'll have to
wait a little bit longer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> compared to season one to
get a new Akihabara special. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But we do want to do one in the future. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Apart from that, I don't
know what other plans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just excited to show
you guys like the new set </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that we have and having a
proper "Trash Taste" office, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not just an apartment that
we just remodeled into a set. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you guys will see
it in the "After Dark" vlog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, like speaking of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there'll be way more "After
Dark" content as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're gonna have two sets now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, the "After Dark" specials aren't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just going to be "Trash Taste" 1.5. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's the main arguments, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the big reasons why we wanna move, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to allow us to make more- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - More content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - More space, more content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause right now it's, you know, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can make content in this room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure we could, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's one of those things where- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But what cost? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you're in a room
that you just despise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's too cramped, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't want to make like stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't feel creative. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't feel like you
want to do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you guys will see when we vlog it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like behind the set
is an absolute mess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And actually, the set is a mess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The entire room, the
entire place is a mess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The beauty of camera angles
is everything looks bigger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but this is, it is not as
neat as you think it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In fact like I get actually
like physically embarrassed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> whenever a guest comes over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's pretty embarrassing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because the one thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the one mutual thing
that every guest says is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Wow, this place is a lot
smaller than it looks." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, yeah, we know, we know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, you know,
when your mom comes in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and your room isn't tidy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I feel like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The first thing I feel
like saying is apologizing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the second thing is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whoever has to explain to the guest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that they're gonna be sitting here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the first thing you
have to explain to them is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how to get here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're just like, oh, you
just got to go around the set. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like you cannot see any of the desks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and we have three desks
over there by the wall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't see any of the desk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> My desk is a fucking war zone
that Maylene's turned to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which was the guest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that thought you had to go under again? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Raina. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, Raina.
- I think it was Raina. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was so little space. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Raina literally thought that
you had to go under the table. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly there's probably
more room under the table. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably, probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's less of a
tripping hazard under here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't fault her for
thinking that honestly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, everything, the
way we've done it is all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it works, but it's literally
the meme of like the Cheeto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> holding the door locked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything works, but it's not clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It looks good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm happy with how it looks
considering what we've got. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the most scuffed
way we can of it looking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as good as it does and
sounding as good as it does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, we really wanna upgrade it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get a better system in
general just for everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Have more guests on, you know,
have guests on "After Dark," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, just having everything upgraded, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything better, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, it's 'cause of you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that we're even able to
fucking move to, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a nicer bigger place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Without the Patreon stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we definitely wouldn't be
able to consider the upgrades </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we're doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically when we started
this podcast, we were just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's the minimum we can get away with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in case this podcast is like zeros, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just crashes and burns immediately, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, we planned this on
like as much of a budget, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as much money as we were
willing to pay it, essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> How much money do we want to lose? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then also hours do we want to lose? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we said this in the previous episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with the Trash Taste Awards, obviously, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but we're very grateful I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the crazy amount of support. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think if you'd have told
us that we'd be this close </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to a million subs after one year, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we'd have been like, funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd be like 100,000
subs that's a success. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We only pushed this channel like what, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> twice on our main channels? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Once at the start of the
video or an end of a video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the Akihabura special. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Considering it's everything
else is driven by like Twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you guys just enjoying the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You guys spreading the good word. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's crazy, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's crazy to see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause normally with
a lot of podcasts I see, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you have like with big names </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you have like
the big announcements. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you've got the big trickle of views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the view just like drips down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is what I was expecting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I wasn't expecting us to
maintain like the view count. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - For 50 episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's also intimidating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause now I know that the stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the dumb shit I say it'll be in front of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more people than ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, one thing I certainly
was surprised by was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like, just realizing
that some of the shit we say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to each other people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like hundreds of thousands
of people are now listening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I forget about everything I fucking say! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Same here! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All the dumb shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I got an email
today about baked beans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Wanted to send me baked beans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I totally forgot I said
I like baked beans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And someone's offering to
send me a ton of baked beans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, I'm flattered.
- You can't say no to that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just can't remember why I said this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I totally forgot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Out of context it just sounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a random person wanting
to send you baked beans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know I went on a rant
about loving baked beans, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that was one of those things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm very passionate in the moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then when I leave I totally forget </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that I had a rant about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I did talk very passionately
about baked beans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That is me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel that's a lot of moments, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, sometimes you just get passionate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're talking with your mates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or when you're in like a fucking zakia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or having like an argument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's not really an argument, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just very passionate in the moment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you reckon we'll get
any comments people like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Man, I like the old set more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Had a better vibe to it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, the table's gonna be the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I stopped watching after season one." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Season one is when it went downhill." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Season two was a real let down." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, essentially it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not too much is gonna change really. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really, okay, to like
bring down expectations, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> really the reason we
want to change offices is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because this is not a
convenient office at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> On camera we don't want
too much to change. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> We just want to work more comfortably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead of having this like
the most jank fucking set up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for everything we do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, right now "Trash Taste
After Dark" is running off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of my laptop, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's three giant ass HDMIs going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> into this man's laptop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The cable management is atrocious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally, it's like, it's
a laptop that's sitting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like hooked up on
like on a foldable chair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like connected with wide internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just running in
the middle of the floor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's "Trash Taste After Dark." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is jank as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's because we can't
afford more space right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it's like the most jank. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's mostly for us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Enough of us complaining
about all our problems I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything should hopefully be better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We don't know 'cause we haven't moved yet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but we're hoping that
everything goes really smoothly! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Offset, I want to shout
out to the Denny's guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're the real G. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Denny's guys is always there for us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've talked before about- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Boss man's always waiting for us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've talked before about how every time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before a "Trash Taste" recording
we have lunch at Denny's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we've gone there so often
that there's a guy at Denny's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who knows the exact time we're
coming in on the exact day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he knows what we want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We order the same thing every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He knows how many people as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've not met a boss man in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I hadn't met the boss man
in Japan until I met that guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're a boss man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's a real boss man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I love it 'cause like
sometimes we would come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into the Denny's and the
moment he sees us, he's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, oh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Four, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I got you, I got you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "I got it reserved for you, don't worry." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gonna miss the MILF bar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's also like next door as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So we discovered a bar- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a restaurant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just it's ran by a hot woman. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just a restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just run by
attractive older Japanese- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Single MILFs in your area. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I remember Connor
first going into there- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he had an awakening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The promised land! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then we almost, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we came back almost
every week for a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The land of milk and honey
is right around the corner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What a beautiful bar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'm gonna miss this area as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, I didn't have much
expectations for this area. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Obviously we don't- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're in a quiet area. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like, you know, we've come to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after a year we've come to
appreciate the small things, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We can say we're in, it's whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I don't think it matters now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're not there anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> We're not there anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So we were in Sitomo, but not anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Commuting was a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Again, everything was on a budget. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Sitomo's outside of
Tokyo, it's like an hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's an hour away from Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's immediately cheaper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just close enough that
it kind of feels like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Kind of like being in zone
four, zone five in London. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like telling your, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the studio is at Heathrow airport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It wasn't that far. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It wasn't that far. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Heathrow airport's like
an hour from central London. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but Tokyo is a
lot bigger as well though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't it? I mean, you can
go from one end of Tokyo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to another in an hour as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I understand these references. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Heathrow, yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Downtown Manhattan, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what I was gonna say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Going to Pennsylvania from New York. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess thank you for watching. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thank you for watching season one. </SPEAKER_00>

the 54 episode pilot. </SPEAKER_03>
