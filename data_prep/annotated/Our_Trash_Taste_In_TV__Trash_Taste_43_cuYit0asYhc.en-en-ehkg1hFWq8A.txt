<SPEAKER_05> (Joey smacks lips) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually wash my
phone, like, once a week. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You wash your phone? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, I just, I don't like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It gets, like, shit on it,
I don't really like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Meilyne] Gets shit on it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I shit on my phone, Meilyne! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why do we talk about
shit, like, every time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, Mudan, don't fucking use this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Use this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (chill music plays) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Welcome to this episode of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wait, which episode are we on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Meilyne] 43.
- 43. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Welcome to episode 43, I heard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wait what is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've never said an episode number </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in the history of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love, "welcome to episode," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "47." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just don't mention the episode name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've never mentioned
an episode number before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna fuckin' do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's 43. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Welcome back to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And once again, I'm with the boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Who is Joey, who is Garnt? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the answer to the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't realize- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is this "Jeopardy?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Who is Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Correct. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who is Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Grant, sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's your daily double. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Who is Grant? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never watched "Jeopardy" before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's good fun actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, why do they have to
answer like, "what is," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, "Grant," or whatever? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because what they,
instead of the question, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they give you, like, an answer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the answer is the question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So, it's like reverse trivia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Grown man finds out what "Jeopardy" is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've only seen, like, out
of context "Jeopardy" tweets, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or "Jeopardy" clips, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've just always tried to figure out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why are they answering in questions? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like it's pretty easy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to figure out what's going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now that you've explained it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course it's going to be easy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> now that you've explained it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one had to tell me what was going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I'm guessing
based on, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what's going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't recall the moment
in my life where I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I need to know how this game works." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Good job, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't even remember the
last time I watched a game show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you watch any game shows growing up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I actually watched quite a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We have quite good ones in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like "How To Be a Millionaire." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That was a classic, classic game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you guys have,
like, "Deal or No Deal?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What country originally made that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - America, but we had,
like, an Australian version. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the British one
went for a long time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who was the host? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Noel Edmonds, yeah.
- Noel Edmonds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you seen the
American "Deal or No Deal?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like "Deal or No Deal" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but, like, it's way more Hollywood-ized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it literally just like
the "Kitchen Nightmares" deal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where like "Kitchen
Nightmares USA" is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You won't believe what happened." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then the UK one is
like, Gordon's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "All right, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You gotta get your act together." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just, it's way bigger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They got like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> instead of just fuckin' Noel Edmonds, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like, opening the briefcase or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've got, like, the proper, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boxing ring chicks that like, you know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, like, the
models'll open up the briefcase, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you compare it to,
like, the British version, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just night and day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, does the British
version not have, 'cause- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have the boxes, we have the boxes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have the boxes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, 'cause in Australia
they took the American thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and lined up, like, 30 chicks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Should we explain what
"Deal or No Deal" is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for someone who might not know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's basically like
a contestant comes on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> opens a bunch of briefcases. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They have to get down to- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you explain "Deal or No Deal?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, wait so they get down
to two boxes, don't they? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, if I remember correctly, you have, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember like 15
boxes or 15 briefcases. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like 25. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 25? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's, like, a lot, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I believe you have to, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to choose random briefcases and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They get knocked out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then like every briefcase
has a different amount </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of money in it, and when
you choose that briefcase, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that amount of money is knocked
out of the prize pool and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but isn't it, they
pick a briefcase first, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they hang onto it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but they don't know what
it is until the very end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, and there's
basically what they do is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is the reason why they
don't just immediately skip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the final one which you pick is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because along the way based on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what you've knocked out or got in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so say you've knocked out
all the lower prize pools </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like the 1,000 pounds, the
2,000, they'll offer you deals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So, the whole point of the
show is that you kind of want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to knock out all the small ones at first, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that they might offer
you a really generous deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause your box might be, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the one that's left that sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was always a really fun game
show, and I really liked it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But in the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if this is
the same in Australia, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but, like, all ages watch,
like, the quiz show or the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just couldn't see, like,
my grandma watching, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> bikini models fuckin' open up boxes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, my grandma was fuckin' obsessed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with "Deal or No Deal." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, my great grandma too as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She watched it every day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, wait, but did
you guys not have, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the supermodels with briefcases? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, our game shows are,
like, unapologetically, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just, like, chill people just doing, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normally for small amounts of money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then on the opposite
of the side of the spectrum, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys have shows
like "Naked Attraction." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's still a
small scale, I would say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even like "Pointless,"
which has been, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you don't know what "Pointless"
is it's kind of hard to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just fuckin' Google it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna explain
every single game show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that we talk about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Pointless," the prize
pool was only ever, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 1,000 pounds, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is, like, to go
on, you know, national TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, $1,500, no $1,300? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not really a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's if you win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You get nothing if you don't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least "Deal or No Deal" had, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the prize pool, the
top prize pool was, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a million dollars or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - $250,000. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - $250,000 or pounds for the UK one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In Australia it was like a million. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's not too far off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you never saw
anyone winning the million. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Prize pools in general
in the UK quiz shows are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty small, except
for, like, the big ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which are marked as, like, the big ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the biggest one we had was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was the whole show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think that was the
biggest one anywhere, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> UK version was probably,
like, the most expensive, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like, fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is our currency so goddamn strong? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - A million pounds is a lot of money! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine a Japanese "Who
Wants To Be a Millionaire?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you just win a million yen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, 10 grand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think, wait, what is it again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Ashley, do you remember,
like, how much money is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for the Japanese "Who
Wants To Be a Millionaire?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] I didn't even know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, nevermind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure it's a million. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No, it's 10 million yen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That would make sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We spoke about it before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember like "Takeshi's Castle." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, the Japanese version, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was three
million yen was the prize. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought for a game
show that fucking hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> $30,000 doesn't seem like
a fair reward for a show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that only like five people ever won. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But in most Japanese quiz shows- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not about the money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, it is about the money, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but when it is about the money,
the max you get is like 10K. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And usually that's split </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because, like, usually it's,
like, a team-based thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, it's like, "You guys win 10K, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "split between the five of you." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So, and then after taxes you
probably get a grand each. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's your, like, favorite Australian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or, like, American game
show that you've ever seen? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - God... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd probably say "Deal or No
Deal" was probably my favorite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really liked "Family Fortunes." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what the
American one is, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Family Feuds?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Family Feuds." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen, like, the American, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, clips of the American one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and that seems as fun if not even better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than the British version. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because, like, on the American
one I feel like they have, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like, more celebrities to choose from. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - We only have like a few
very giant celebrities. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we had like Les Dennis, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I don't even remember
what he was famous for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the first place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because like in America
you have, like, celebrities, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> which normally are known,
like, the world over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just 'cause how it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But in the UK you have like
two tiers of celebrities </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which are like legit, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> massive celebrities known
all around the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you know, like,
normally musical artists </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or, like, really big actors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then the local- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you have, like,
the locally known ones, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which are normally like just, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the comedians are pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But, like, outside of
that, you have, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone who's like, he
said a racist word on TV </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and made a career out of it one time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, all right, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Same with Australia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's same in Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, you're either
an internationally known, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, star who's hosting the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you're an Australian
comedian that failed to, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> market themselves outside of Australia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, it's just like,
"We'll give you a spot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "You speak in an Australian accent." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We had this one game show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it was, I don't know
if it was British first. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It was called "Golden Balls." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you ever watch this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I did watch that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, yeah, that was cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tee hee, golden balls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So what would happen is is
that they would get, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> five balls each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they all had different
amounts of money in them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you have to,
like, negotiate, I think... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, so- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who to kickoff? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, a football game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't actually seen it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I've, I think we're
thinking of the right one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where the last round- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The last round is the best one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is the most interesting one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, you have a prize pool, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's I think it's based on, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the prisoner's dilemma or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm probably wrong on that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, you have two people, and
you basically have to agree </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're going to share the prize pool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or, like, okay so- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have to steal or share. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you can steal
the entire prize pool, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you can share the prize pool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you share, if
both people pick share </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you share the prize money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if one person picks steal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they get the entire
amount of the prize money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But if both people pick steal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> then nobody gets the prize money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just saw, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the biggest pieces of shit on this show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, yeah, you'd win the money, but like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That really seems like a show to, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> expose the worst side of humanity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was brutal, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause this TV show fuckin' loved it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Bro, whatever you gotta
do to get this money, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "you ham it up." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, these people would do
like massive sob stories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the person next to them,
and they would believe them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They'd be like, "Man, my kids, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "they need this thing real bad, man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "They need this
expensive thing," et cetera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they, you know, they would do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they reveal it like
they stole all the money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and everyone's like, okay,
sure you won 10 grand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but at what cost? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - At what cost? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> They go through their entire
life story to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm a devout Christian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I've given to charity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I am the most honest
person you could ever meet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "in your life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "JK." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They literally did a
Dio and was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm going to reject humanity, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "to get this money." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember this one guy- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I've seen the same clip. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which one was it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The guy who just fucking hacked, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, social hacked the
game where he was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "Look mate, I'm gonna pick steal." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've seen it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Such a, like, a fivehead move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He literally goes to the guy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Look, I'm not even gonna pretend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm going to pick steal, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "And what I'm going to do is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm going to share half
the prize money with you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "once the game's over." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the other guys was like,
"No, you can't do that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, "No, we're gonna pick share. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "We're gonna at least
agree to pick share." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, "Nope, I'm picking steal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "and you're gonna have to trust me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "that I'm going to share the prize money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "after the show ends." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, like, the other guy asked the host, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Is this allowed? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Is this actually allowed?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And the host goes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Whatever happens after this
show, we can't guarantee." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So he's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So if you get shanked,
that's your issue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, so he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well, I'm going to pick
steal as well then." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, "Fine, if you pick steal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "we're both going to lose the money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "But the only chance you're
gonna have to gain money is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "by picking share." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Such a fucking fivehead move. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Asshole move. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like reverse reverse psychology. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, but at the end he didn't pick steal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> He picked share. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So, both of them got the
prize money in the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh shit.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was just like, dude, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this guy is the main protagonist
of the fucking universe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What a fivehead move, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is literally, like, the martyr. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'll be the bad guy so
that everyone can win." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I just watched, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> IRL "Code Geass" right in front of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is literally "Code Geass." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is what I saw right here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw, like, I swear, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if this
was like a popular clip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember one time a guy, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally came into the show, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there's four contestants
at the start, I believe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was literally just right
from the start being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm gonna steal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm gonna steal no matter what." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he stole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he didn't get anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the person also stole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it's like the same thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but like small brain version. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, "I'm gonna
steal," to everyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's like, "Yeah, we know." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm not giving you anything." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "So am I." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine you wait for months, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you go through all
the interviews and shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get on the show finally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have a chance of winning money, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and some fucking asshole
immediately said to everyone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm gonna ruin the show for all of you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't give a fuck." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You'd be like, "Well fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "What am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what's the fuck the thing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "The Millionaire Hot Seat" thing as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Did you have those? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, we don't have that I don't think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, 'cause I don't
know if it was in America. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We definitely had it in Australia though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, there's like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's like "Who Wants
To Be a Millionaire?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is just like a one-on-one thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There was this other version of it called </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "Millionaire Hot Seat" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is basically, it's
one game of millionaire, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then there's, like, four
other people basically, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting on the benches, waiting
for the person to fuck up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if one person gets the answer wrong- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They swap? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then it goes to the next
person from where they started. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's pretty cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so I saw this clip, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like you start
off with five people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they got to, I don't
know, it was like the 2,000, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, not even
halfway up kind of thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I guess it was, like,
a really hard question. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, the first guy gets it wrong, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's like, "Oh fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "See you later." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Next person comes on fully
confident being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Well he just basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "just got rid of one
of the answers for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I got this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And not only does he get it wrong, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then the next person during 50/50, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he also gets it wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, the fourth person comes up, is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "So, there's only one answer remaining. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I think it's this one." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "You're correct!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But, like, imagine waiting,
sitting on the benches </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all that time to just come up and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Thank you for giving me this money." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Thank you for the free money." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Thank you for the free money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "JK, see ya later." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm trying to remember
what else was there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "The Weakest Link." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You remember "The Weakest Link?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause remember,
like, what's his name? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Was it Phil or Dan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which one of them was
on "The Weakest Link?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, were they actually? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah one of them- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The YouTubers? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, one of them was
on "The Weakest Link." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's "The Weakest Link?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it's this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not going anymore, is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was this really
popular daytime British TV show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where we had this, like, really, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she was famous for being
like bitch basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that was her whole
character was that she was rude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I can't remember her name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it was just a quiz show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And basically, like, it
would just keep going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and asking questions,
and you basically, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of the question
round, they'd ask eight people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to vote someone off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was normally the person
who was letting the team down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you've got a question wrong, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you, like, ruined the streak. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like a video game
where more streak, more points. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, if someone gets a
question wrong, they ruin it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you get less money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you, so, like,
as it's going around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so if I get one right, I get 100 points. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then you get 200, then 400, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone has to like say "bank," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that the points get saved. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, the streak can keep
going until someone saves it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, if you're the one who's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm gonna get the big boy question," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you fuck it up and lose the money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that everyone just earned, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're probably gonna get voted off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then, like, there was
a meta game behind it as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because if you were too good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> then people would just like
gang up on you and vote you off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because they didn't have
as much a chance of winning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you were on the game show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sounds brutal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think, I can't
remember which one it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was Dan or Phil. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One of them was on it before
they became a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You should watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, like, the host is
just, like, roasting them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really endearing watching someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> before they were a YouTuber, like, do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It was really fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've always wanted to be on,
like, trivia shows like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I think
I'd like to go on a show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that has like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally that is just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hey, this is just a game show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just go up and do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, no, like acts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No fuckin' like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, play this character." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No, just let me just fuckin' go on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and make a fool of myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, is there like a what's really, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are game shows still going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think, like, it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd like to think that most game shows are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the complete opposite of,
like, the talent shows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause the talent shows are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just heavily scripted
narratives and all this stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think we just don't know
'cause we don't watch TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I just stopped watching TV, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so I actually have no
fucking idea anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Me too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> There was this YouTuber
now who's uploading, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> he entered an American talent
show that I'd never heard of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think he's called
Reckless Ben on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's like, he basically
signed up for this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then wore secret
glasses while he's on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, now he's uploading videos
of him behind the scenes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and his narration is really fuckin' funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, now they're just, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> threatening him to take the videos down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And he's uploading videos being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm not gonna take it down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Here's the next video." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I'm taking it down." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really interesting- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Living up to his name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause he's
just, like, he's in it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's just narrating really stupid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's just like a complete clown </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like the best way possible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, it's really interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You should watch these YouTube videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't sell it very well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like, I don't
wanna explain too much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You should just go watch them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really, really underrated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one's watching these videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> They have like 80K, 100K. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's still a decent amount. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, for something,
like, as crazy as this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd think it'd be a lot bigger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it like even a big
kind of exposure that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hey, this is kind of faked
and it's all scripted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really fun just seeing,
like, a producer go up to him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, "No, not now," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or, "Hey, this is your," like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, like, you know like
when the crowd's cheering? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> He shows, like, the
video footage of, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the show see then he
cuts to what's happening to him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just him in the
middle of a giant stage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's nothing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, no noise or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think there's a big difference
between just like hearing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and knowing that it's rigged
versus actually seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's rigged. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know like all those
talent shows as well have, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> onsite therapists because of, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how, like, brutal the schedule is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, some of them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in like "America's Got Talent"
had to, like, sit around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like 19 hours to,
like, wait to practice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fucking hell.
- Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, they had onsite
therapists and they would, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there was, like, cases
where they're injecting them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with, like, vitamins and
stuff to keep them awake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> during the show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and then obviously, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these contracts you sign
which have come up before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for like "X-Factor" in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, like some of them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I swear it was "X-Factor UK" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where you literally sign away your rights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to anything you've ever done online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and anything you do in future ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, if you became a
YouTuber, they own it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you can't do it
without their permission. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's nuts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I get why they do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they want to cover their ass, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they go, like, so beyond </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like, this is kind of like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is kind of just exploitive now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People want their five minutes
of fame, right, that's why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's like, what are you gonna do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Get five minutes of fame yourself? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I don't think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What are you gonna do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Build a career? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Good one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Good one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Not without my help." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not without Simon Cowell fucking
breathing down your throat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll tell you what Sydney's
been watching recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> She's been like, she's gone
off the true crime for a bit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she's just-
- Oh has she? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, she's now turned over to trash TV, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> reality trash TV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's been watching "90 Day Fiance." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bro, I could just feel the scripts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I'm watching that show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you can tell that the
producers have made them do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, two, three takes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't stand it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched like one whole season of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was just like, they just repeat- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You watched one whole season? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've watched a whole season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm impressed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I really don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't enjoy half of it either. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was watching it and it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they go in fuckin' circles. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They'll be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so they'll meet up and they'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, it's kind of weird,
but we just love each other." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there'll just be, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> red flags right from the start. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "He asked me to PayPal him like 10 grand." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, "He doesn't want to have kids. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "I want to have kids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "But you know, I think love has a way." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The shittiest, like, love drama, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I feel like watching
"90 Day Fiance," right- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I lose brain cells watching this show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I lose brain cells
watching it, but I think it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, I imagined what if it aired, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on Twitch or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it would be a
fuckin' excellent experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if something like that aired on Twitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, unscripted? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, unscripted? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I mean just, like, watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with, like, the Twitch chat
to see all the reactions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's like part of the fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The worst part about watching
it, like, in seasons was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like, without the YouTube comments, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "90 Day Fiance" is like 90% less enjoyable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because the best comments were, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> making sure that everyone agrees with you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> on who's the bigger asshole. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's, like, literally
like the real life version </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of am I the asshole, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, you go there
to see the spicy drama </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but watching it by yourself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel is just you lose half
of the enjoyment out of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did you sit through,
like, a normal episode of that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it was hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, like, I watched, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause obviously, like,
anybody I got into it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through the fuckin' Ed and
Rose clips that went around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, me too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, I was just like, oh,
if the clips are this good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> then I'm pretty sure the
entire episode is good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, 'cause like the- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's such a drag. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is one of those TV shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where like the clip is
the best way to watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Watching this was, like, brutal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, none of these couples
are, like, good people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're all just, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the worst people doing the
shittiest things to each other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then being surprised
when none of it works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, it is horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, like, it's trash TV, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean, you know why
you're watching it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No one's watching it to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe this situation will work out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And this girl's like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This guy who's on his 10th marriage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "and I've only known for three months, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't know if he really loves me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is like those- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, no way! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what it's like! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is like someone has made a playbook </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of like the worst setups to relationships. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's always like someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who can't speak the
other person's language, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so they just can't communicate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most of the time it's that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, what the fuck are you doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Meilyne! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the hell was that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're recording! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You watching "90 Day Fiance" over there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meilyne's just loading up an
episode right now apparently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, what are they talking about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was like one where it
was like the girl's like 18 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the guy's 46 and has two kids. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, that just
sounds like a bad idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like Ed and Rose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was like that and someone else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What was the other one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was, like, these, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was one of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like a South African guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and other one was like an American. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, she was like super
activist and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, he was just kind of
like the most laid back man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> on earth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, "Yeah, yeah,
whatever, wherever." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "I need you to know that I
care about these things." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And she was psychotic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And, like, watching her, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> behave around this guy was, like, awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, this is terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> This is awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why is he doing this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> How much is he getting paid? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it's TLC.
- Are they getting paid? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I need to know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's TLC so they're definitely paid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you sure they're getting paid? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're getting paid pennies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, 'cause I feel like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hope they're getting paid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because if they're not getting paid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why they're putting
up with half of this shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, it is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure TLC pays all
of the people that they have- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you sure? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But yeah, but, like, I use
the word "paid" very loosely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, they're probably getting
paid scraps for that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's just like, I'm watching this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, how much
would you have to pay me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you know that
Rose, the Filipino girl, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> she's like a YouTuber now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I saw. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, it's just like, you
probably got paid shit all, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but hey, you got a YouTube
career now I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You have a following. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like a situation where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if the other side is
just so goddamn awful, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it makes you look amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ed did her a solid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's always weird for me
watching American reality TV show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> versus British reality TV show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I feel like British
reality TV show is, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so much more toned down than American. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I think one of the thing
of British reality TV shows, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the peak that comes to
me is something like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Come Dine With Me." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's pretty good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Or like what's the other one
that that fuckin' guy does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you just come up to him at a table </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and he buys shit off
you for like 100 quid? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Antique Hunters or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, "Antiques Roadshow." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Antiques Roadshow." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like that show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Show's literally been
on the air for, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how long and
it's just fun to watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People just bring in some things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'll give you fuckin' 20 quid for it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the fuckin',
you know, like "Pawn Stars." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like legit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like more legit than that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, "Come Dine With Me" is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> probably the best British
reality TV show I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One of my favorite trash
reality TV shows on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember the name, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the concept is they take
this couple who, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't have a lot of money,
but want to get married. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Cheapest Weddings," right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not "Cheapest Weddings." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the Australian version. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that the Australian version? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the Australian version. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They give them 10K to
sort out this wedding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like, the bride has no control. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> She doesn't know anything,
and it's all up to the guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aki's obsessed with that show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a BBC Three show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Who Called the Bride?"
or something like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Who Wants the Bride?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But it was such a good
concept in my opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause like 10K I feel like
is just the right amount </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of money to be able to
make a wedding happen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but not enough to make everything you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out of a wedding happen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's pretty genius. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's genius. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And, like, making the guy do it as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, you don't
need producers, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You just sit there and follow the guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If he does nothing,
that's fantastic content. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - They must be fully aware of it too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause they always choose to use the 10K </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in the worst fucking way imaginable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We should've done that
with Garnt's wedding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey, Garnt, here's 10K. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Go for it, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The guys in the show, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the first thing they do
is like call up the crew. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They call up their
boys, and they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like the main guy
will be fucking clueless. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that one friend who's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I really don't think you
should hire inflatable dinosaurs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "for your wedding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "That seems like a bad idea." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Nah, nah, I got this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is my wedding." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's always like, there's always that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's either the guy who like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there was never a guy who
got it like 100% right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was a guy who was like pretty close, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it like did a modest attempt, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there was just the
other type of guy that was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm gonna do fucking
Star Wars themed wedding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "It's my wedding!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - My favorite one is the one where, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the groom like decides to get
married in like a pig barn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yes, I've seen this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - They deadass go to, like,
a farm with like fuckin' mud- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like muddy, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's like, "But you love pigs." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I saw one where the guy, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hosted the wedding in a cave,
like a proper, an actual cave. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's badass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's badass, but then like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he knew that the bride's
mum was claustrophobic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How to get rid of the in-laws. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, the bride's mum actually
couldn't attend, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the wedding ceremony. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Standing outside the cave. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's fuckin' big brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's so big brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "So, my in-laws hate boats, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "so I decided let's get on a cruise." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - As someone who's, like,
planning a wedding now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's great for me 'cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I see the stress that people- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Giving a survey to,
like, Sydney's family. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "So what are your fears by the way? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Spiders?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "What are you afraid of?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - "We talkin' like zoos?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My favorite moment is always </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> when they try to pick the dress. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's never, it's not even
like a little bit wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's always the complete opposite
of what the bride picked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's literally like and one, two, three, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and have a breakdown, have a
mental breakdown right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Start crying, start telling
him the wedding's over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally how it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Guys, we talk about shitting
a lot on this podcast, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We do, we do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We do admittedly, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Now don't you want to shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the privacy of the
bathroom door locked? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, using the internet
without ExpressVPN is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like going to the bathroom
and not closing the door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, why would we want to do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That just sounds barbaric,
and I will not stand for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm being told that
internet service providers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like Comcast or Verizon know
every single website you visit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's really interesting information </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've also heard that
ISPs can sell this information </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to ad companies and tech giants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who then use your data to target you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] ExpressVPN creates
a secure encrypted tunnel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between your device and the internet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so your online activity
can't be seen by anyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's as easy as closing
the bathroom door. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Simply fire up the app
and press one button. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I use this all the time
when I'm watching anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as certain websites don't
let you watch from Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and trust me, it's fuckin' easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What device do you use it on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every single device I have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My PC, my phone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> probably my refrigerator
soon when it gets installed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Not only that,
but it's rated number one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by CNET, Wired, The Verge,
and other creditable sources. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's actually quite cheap per month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - ExpressVPN has been
a game changer for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I cannot tell that
I'm even connected to a VPN. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's no losses in speed whatsoever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, what are you waiting for? </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would, you know, even if I got, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> paid on top of doing the wedding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm assuming the,
like, kind of the reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why people apply for that show
is you get a free wedding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, like, man,
organizing a wedding seems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like one of the easiest
things to get wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought about this- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the most nervous laughter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought about this
and I was like, "Goddamn." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just the like, 'cause you know, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have friends, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like not every friend you
want to come to your wedding, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It must be so fucking
awkward deciding, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're a good enough friend, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like, I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you're like good
enough for the wedding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can barely organize a boys' night out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let alone a fucking wedding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause also, like, how
many friends do you have? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, where do you draw the line? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who's close enough? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How do you decide? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it like a mutual thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You're like, "No, I don't like Ted." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wedding politics is
like definitely a thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, my cousin went through it as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a lot that goes
into a wedding that I, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have no interest.
- Didn't foresee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't obviously, it's, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to plan a wedding
yourself is hard enough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to plan a wedding when
you're not in the country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and also during, like, COVID hit- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hard mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is like not even like hard mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like Dark Souls no hit run. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, there's so many
things that can, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that can fuck up as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love how nowadays </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever anything is like extremely hard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the first thing you think
of is Dark Souls no hit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Nothing's harder than that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's stressful,
but it's rewarding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it must be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> If Sydney's watching, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's rewarding until, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like, it will be rewarding once
it actually finishes, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And everything goes smoothly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like the planning parts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> some of it's better than the others. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I remember, like, my
favorite moment so far has been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> actually going to the venue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just being like,
yeah, this is the place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's an amazing feeling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything up to that, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> searching through about 50
catalogs of possible places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and driving to about 10 different places, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and being like, "Do I
want to settle on this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can I see myself
getting married in a barn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "or a cave or whatever?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - In Japan it's, like, crazy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how, like, fucking
seriously they take this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, it's even, it's
like in Asia they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we think there's like wedding
politics in Western weddings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, in Asia it's a fuckin' statement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I hate that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I absolutely hate that 'cause- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's so many unspoken
rules in an Asian wedding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The amount that they must
spend on weddings here- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's nuts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you go to, like, any,
like, fancy hotel in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, you just, 'cause you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you go there for, like,
a lunch or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll see that, like, the
wedding planning rooms are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like full with people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, those prices don't seem cheap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They seem real expensive! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, 50K on a wedding, I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I went to one
of my friend's weddings </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from university and he
did it in Japan in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the inside of this venue looked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a fuckin' mini Disneyland. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, there was, like, a castle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and, like, a fuckin' fountain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this, like, massive
completely white church. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, how much money
did you spend on that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, what amount of
money is too much to spend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on a wedding? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get that it's a special day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there has to be a limit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where like special day
is, like, ridiculous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not to mention, there was
like 300 people at this wedding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because like,
nobody knows 300 people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even know if I even have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that many friends on Facebook, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> let alone at a wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you get, like, families asking like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey, can my like family
friend of a friend come?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you get, like, that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I feel like that, I'd be like, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Hell fuckin' no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Japan, it's, like, the
wedding politics extends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to, like, you have to invite work people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's all about face, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so, like, in Thailand, you
have to invite your family, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your family friends, your work colleagues, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, basically everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, close colleagues, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - If they're actual mates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not inviting my boss. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Another thing about Thai weddings is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meilyne's like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Shut up, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is why, like,
me and Sydney decided </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to have our wedding in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, we didn't have to worry
about, you know, that side of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All that bullshit, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, like, it's a customary
in Thai weddings as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the groom has to give money, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> has to give, like, a
certain amount of money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the bride's, like, family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - For the father to accept or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What era are we in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you buying her? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that like an extra step? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "How much is your daughter? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I give you two goats." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is there, like, an auction? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, what is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's, like, fuckin'
Russian, like, mother, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like, "I'll give you two goats." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This feels like an extra
step to, like, auction. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, it's something
that I don't agree with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've seen, like, some
of my family members do it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of don't agree with this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that where it comes from? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, where does that come from? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, I have no idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does it come from some more sinister, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like way back- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It must. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It must've. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I'm not sure
how the custom started </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because, you know, it's something that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've attended Thai weddings
and I've seen happen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never kind of asked
where this came from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I just kind of was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, I don't think I want to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Did you buy Mom?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "A cheap price." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I did it at a deal, son." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I mean, it's all bargained." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's also, like, the same
customary where it's, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the bride's dad is expected
to pay for the wedding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, no, that
shouldn't be the case either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me a wedding there's so
many customaries to weddings </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that revolve around money
that I just don't understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess 'cause, like, maybe, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean that's pretty
common in the West still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that the other person- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The bride- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The bride's parents will pay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, it's understandable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when marriage used to
be way younger, like 21. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I get it then 'cause
you don't have any money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But now people are
getting married at what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, 27, 30. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, it's like, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, probably should
have your own money by then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably shouldn't be planning a wedding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if you're unemployed at 30. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, maybe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just dissing some people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, just saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sorry for that guy
who just like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had, like, five children </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and all of them ended up being daughters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Come on, son, son, son! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh God!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the, like, aging population, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like, pyramid thing where it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "It won't bite you now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "It'll bite you later." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because isn't there, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember I saw like this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't remember if it
was a "Vice" documentary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or some kind of documentary
on YouTube where, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot which country it was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somewhere in the Middle East where, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they still have the tradition
of, like, wife-napping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where it's like, they, I
forgot which country it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember I saw this documentary, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's this tradition, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "tradition," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where guys, if they find a
girl that they find attractive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they see as "wife material," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of them will actually,
like, deadass kidnap them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in broad daylight, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take them back to their parents' place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the girl is then forced
to get married to this guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, fuckin' real life Pokemon? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This sounds like Runescape. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> This sounds like Runescape. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, traditionally
the girl can't decline it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so, like, she has to get married. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And there's all these, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and this documentary I saw is, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so fuckin' disturbing
'cause there's these girls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who are literally just breaking down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while they get the veil put
on top of them and shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just, it's fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I could remember the
name of the documentary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally the "Trash
Taste" podcast is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "There was this thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't remember though." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just look it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If look up, like, "wife-napping"
I think it's called. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Trash Taste" podcast,
early onset Alzheimer's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just fucking forgetting,
we forget everything here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> We can't remember anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We're fucking useless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This thing I saw on the
internet I vaguely remember about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's one detail I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that I want to talk about now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and just share it to the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucked up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember perfect example
of that I think was the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was one episode we
were talking about, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how very rarely, like,
anime uses English, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> songs in the openings and endings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we're bringing up all these titles, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we're like, I'm sure there's
other ones we don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> All the titles are, like, "Jojo." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hello? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You know that one show
you're all obsessed about?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just forget everything all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like when you're put on the spot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially when you're put on the spot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you're recording. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you're recording, it's just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Never take our word on anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just the golden rule. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Never take our word on anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We are not liable for anything that we- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I don't forget though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it happened to me right yesterday? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got stopped by the police. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean?
- What did you do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm a criminal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What illegal activity- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Being white! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm joking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Being a minority for once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, what did you do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nothing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I was, literally nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, I was literally, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, so I'm coming up the
escalator to, like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause in Japan you have to, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ding out of the gates, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm coming up to the escalator
to go through the gates, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's like two pylons, two sets, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so I'm coming up the escalator. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I'm gonna go forward, to go out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and literally hiding behind
the pylon is a police officer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when I pass him,
I've got headphones on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got a, like, cap on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so, like, maybe I look fuckin' dodgy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But literally when I pass this guy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I see like in my corner of my
eye this guy jump in action. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just immediately come
up to me and stop me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What have I done, dude?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'm like, "What's wrong?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, ah, so I won't
say anything in Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just translate it all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Oh, where are you going?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Just going home, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Just chilling out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why, what's up?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, "Oh, really, cool, cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "Can I see your card?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you have, like, a
foreigners card, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which by law, you always
have to have this foreigner, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what's it called? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Zairyu card. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And he asked me if Japanese's okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Yeah, I can
speak a little bit." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And luckily like everything
he said I understood, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so it was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like, "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And by the way, like,
my train is in, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think like four minutes,
so I'm like, "Come on, mate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Come on." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, "Keep it up, keep it up." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, he looks at my card and it says like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, I'm an entertainer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, "Oh, cool, cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "What do you do?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, oh, I say, "Seiyu" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which means like voice actor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Ah, seiyu." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he's like, "Oh, sensei." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So, like, Japanese teacher. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I literally just told you,
why would it be entertainer? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just sitting there
like, "Oh no, no, no." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, "Seiyu, seiyu." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, commercials, games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "Oh, games." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Yeah, yeah games." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "What games?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like,
what do you want me to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you gonna look it up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, what do you want? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm like, "Oh, it's an English. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "It's an English." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Deadass, right, he goes,
"Oh, do you play Apex?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No joke. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's, like, 40, maybe 50. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Deadass asked me if I play Apex. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just sitting here, like, laughing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm like, fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I shit you not I say,
"Yeah, I'm diamond rank." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He goes, (speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which means like, "Oh, you're strong." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, like two minutes, two minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My train's in two minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, "Oh cool,
you're from the UK." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, from the UK." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like, and then this
point, I feel like, ah, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kind of like, I know
he's not gonna, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's just making conversation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's just talking to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sounds like he's just
looking for a friend right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know why he's talking to me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He doesn't say why he stopped me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> He doesn't say anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe he was one of the Japanese dudes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you played Apex with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe, maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He just looks at you, and he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "This guy gives off gamer energy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'ma stop him." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I wonder if that guy plays Apex. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm gonna stop him and ask him." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And so, yeah, so I'm like,
"Yeah, I'm from the UK." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He asked where I'm from. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, he can speak good English then? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, it's all in Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - He can speak, he was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Luckily everything he
said, I either understood </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or understood enough of what he's saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to figure out what he's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, he said something
about something going to UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something, something marriage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Ah," and
I said like, honeymoon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like katakana, like, "Ah honeymoon." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, he told me that he went
to the UK and he loved it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> He said, "Okii Ben." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okii Ben! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - He said he liked Big Ben,
and he liked Buckingham Palace. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He said, the Japanese
word for palace which is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He said that something palace. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he said, "Buckingham
(speaks Japanese)" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, I'm pretty sure
he's saying Buckingham Palace. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, it's beautiful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "It's beautiful." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't get over Okii Ben. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okii Ben! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I was, like, laughing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I don't want to laugh though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> He's a police officer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He'll be like, "Why are you laughing?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you guys know
what ben means, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It means shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So saying, "okii ben." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is like deadass means "giant shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's pretty shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's pretty shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Big shit, big shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the big shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought he, 'cause I thought
the word for shit was unko? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, ben is another word for it, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, yeah, and then he
was just like, "Paris." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Oh yeah, you like wine?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He was like, "Yeah, me
and my wife love wine." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Cool, cool, I like wine too." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, "All right,
yeah, you can go now." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Thanks man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Thanks for making me
miss my fucking train." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I had to wait 10 minutes for the next one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you deadass just bonded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with a police officer over Apex. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, luckily it was nice, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like, it's pretty, like, alerting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> when you first stop you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, why are you stopping me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why are you stopping me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then someone told
me, they were like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> apparently there's, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some police officers have quotas of, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people they have to stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They've just got so
little work to do here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And they're normally told to- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess they're getting
paid to do something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is, like, the least, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> xenophobic way of, like, saying this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I've been told, I
don't know if this is true, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some police officers are
told to stop foreigners </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to practice their English. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That makes sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it feels wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, if that happened in another country, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it'd be like, that's fucked
up, that's not right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But I mean, you know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At least they're nice
about it though, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I just don't like
that they asked, like, my ID. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know something
about that feels weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess they- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, check my card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think because they're obligated to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think they have to do that, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause if there's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Feels threatening when
someone asks your ID. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, there's never a way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where a policeman asks for your ID, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't at least sweat a little. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm like (breathes heavily) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You do the like audible swallow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is literally like
white guy gets, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> discriminated first time in his life POV. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> This is the story, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "So this is what it feels
like to be a minority." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This is fucked up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know it's fucking bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, yeah, I mean,
it's happened a few times, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was 'cause it
happened at like 10:00 PM. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for some reason when it happens at night, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it feels like way more like whoa. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, why aren't
you stopping anyone else? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm the only non-Japanese here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, you shouldn't have told
this story on "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You could have easily made a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "My first racist experience
in Japan" type of video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll do it on a live stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So, the clip can come out before this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Good idea, good idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Big brain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just like, I just
started cracking up so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when he asked me if I played Apex. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, you can't make this shit up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I knew when I was
gonna tell the story, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people are gonna be
like, "That's bullshit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, it actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish I fucking recorded. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This like, yeah, and everyone applauded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, this is too unreal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that he literally just
asked me if I play Apex. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I literally, like, don't
shut up about to everyone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's really popular in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's massive in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are, like, the
biggest games in Japan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What genre of games? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> In first person shooters? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's, like, Apex right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, 'cause are online
games big in Japan even? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, there's a huge scene for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Apex right now is massive because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because shockingly because of
VTubers that are playing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was popular before that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but the VTubers
propelled the fuck out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because like
when we moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think is when- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - PubG was big, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - PubG was big, but I think
Apex either just released </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or released like a while back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they were doing a huge push for it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the month where he moved here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every single ad I got was Apex Legends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Japan, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I thought, wow, that's kind of weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's kinda like a
dead game in, like, the West </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or at least it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it flip flops in
whether it's popular or not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What even counts as a
dead game anymore, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Overwatch I'd say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> That's 'cause Overwatch 2's coming out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they just like abandoned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like, you know,
I mean not a dead game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like not in, like,
the public discourse is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> what I would consider like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when people say "dead game," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that's what they mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, it's not like no one plays it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The main population is
talking about it or not, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like it's not like you, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're not expected to have
some general knowledge about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're not expected to
have a police officer come up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to you and say, "Do you play Overwatch?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're like, "Dead game." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Who do you main? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Who's your Overwatch main?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna sound like such
a fucking boomer right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, what even are the
popular games right now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like when I think- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I feel that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I think popular
game, I think, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever the fad is right now,
like Among Us and Fall Guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well I think, after the
Among Us kind of like settled, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it definitely became a bit more variety. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, tends to be quite a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, Valheim is picking up steam, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is kind of like a
re-imagining of Runescape almost. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - All I've heard Valheim is is just, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Minecraft but better graphics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I heard Runescape mixed with Minecraft. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apex is obviously had
a really big resurgence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Really good numbers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, a lot of big streamers
are getting back into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think Valorant is
still doing pretty well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Leagues, obviously Leagues. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - League's just always up there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think CS Go is still the same thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's always been, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like kind of like, you know,
the scrappy little underdog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I think the thing is, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I look at the top watched games on Twitch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're normally, like, the games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I just never end up playing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I don't actually,
I never actually know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what everyone ends up playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or what's kind of popular right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We haven't had any
massive games recently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> After Among Us we haven't
really had anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's stolen the
spotlight, I don't think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could be wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the last time I spoke about games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I got things very wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> People gave me shit, and
that's fair enough, go ahead. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like the whole
idea of, like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like, the most popular game
nowadays is a little bit blurred </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just because, like, anyone
can play anything now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like it's like
there's gonna be the top games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, chess has had a
big resurgence obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bloons Tower Defense 6,
man, I'm telling you, man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's coming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone's playing it, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm stepping in before it gets big. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fortnite obviously is just Fortnite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I feel like a lot of games are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just kind of like settled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> We haven't really had
anything that's shaken up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, I remember
for the longest time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when the League community
where everyone was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yo, League's dying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "League's dying." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's never gonna die. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's never gonna die. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It plateaued. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I feel like there's a difference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> between something plateauing
and something kind of, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also the League
viewership has been, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty consistent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just because it plateaus
doesn't mean it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, dying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, League is still like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you can still easily support
a billion dollar company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with the amount of people
playing it, so you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's like, in public
discourse, right, and all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I usually chalk up to whether
a game is popular if like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Minecraft as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, the younger
generation are playing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - True. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, if you go to
like a primary school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're talking about Apex
and Fortnite and Minecraft </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> then it's like, okay, this is
like the big games right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's funny, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, my mom was telling me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she works in a primary school, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she's telling me like one
kid got, like, really bullied </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because he was, like, bad at Fortnite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, wasn't there a, there was a story- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Skin as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there was a story in
Japan where a kid got bullied </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because he had the
default skin in Fortnite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Serves him right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I think we've
talked about this before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I've heard the same story as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, I think
Minecraft is definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably the biggest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd say Minecraft is still the biggest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Minecraft's just a
juggernaut at this point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Since the last stream, I've been like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> ooh, should I play Minecraft? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Play Minecraft, dude! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Should I play Minecraft? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's deadass so fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so relaxing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If we all play Minecraft,
you guys gotta try Apex. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> We should do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We should do, like, a game
cultural cross-pollination. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cross-pollination. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We should do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what the people want, Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're just never gonna
give up on this, are you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I know if you guys try
it, you'll have a good time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I reckon you guys will enjoy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Will we?
- Yeah, I think you will. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think every person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> who offered me an FPS
game said the same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause this is with
the boys, so you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I heard it about Fortnite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I heard it about Overwatch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've already talked about this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll give it a shot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We'll give it a shot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We'll try it, guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't worry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll convince them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, I guess switching gears. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you guys hear about
this, like, deepfake story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that happened, I think today or yesterday? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yesterday for us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but probably like three
weeks for the audience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, three weeks for the audience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, facts may come out and
we could be totally wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - With deepfake becoming such a, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, a bigger thing now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so I can't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're gonna go back to this! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember every
detail of the story, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think the main gist of it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there was this mom and she had a daughter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who was on the cheerleading squad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can we get Meilyne to check the story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> while we're talking about it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just Google deepfake news. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It'll be, like, the top story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, I believe there was
a mum who had a daughter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who was on the cheerleading squad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there were other girls
on that cheerleading squad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and for some reason she wanted the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> she wanted to kick these
other girls off of the squad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, what she did is she
made some deepfakes, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the other girls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, smoking, drinking- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like smoking, drinking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> doing like bad illegal
activities or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think threatening them with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember if she threatened them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or she sent them straight to- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not sure how she did
it, but I think they saw it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the reason why it
got even found out was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because they took it to the police. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, a few of them went to the police. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and how she got found out was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> she used the fake number. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She used like this internet service </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that gave her a fake number, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but that didn't hide her IP address. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's the only
reason she got found out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cut to the sponsor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - This episode is sponsored by (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, I don't think
she would've got caught </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if she was sponsored by (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think our sponsor
would be very happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why we're not
gonna mention any names. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but I mean, I saw
it, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't believe it actually took this long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for something like this to happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what the most
unbelievable part of the story is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a mom out there
that's tech savvy enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what I thought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even think my mum knows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what a fuckin' deepfake is, let alone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she doesn't even know how to
search for files on Windows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm actually impressed her mum
knew how to make a deepfake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm impressed that mum
knew how to do a deepfake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm even more like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because, okay, I'm not sure
if any of this is confirmed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I'm gonna put out a disclaimer that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We could be totally wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Please check the story.
- Do your own research. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - By the time this comes out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> All right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll check the story while- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - By the time this comes out,
everything might be confirmed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This might all have been,
like, false information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or it might've just been, like, claims. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the time of recording, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we don't know if it's real or not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But these are what the allegations are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the allegation was that she did this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the daughters on
the cheerleading squad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> She stopped hanging out with her daughter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so she wanted to get them
kicked off because of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if someone's this petty to be this crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How dare you not be
friends with my daughter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How does she manage to
figure out how to do deepfakes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - She also sent them anonymous
messages telling them to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they should, you know,
end their own lives as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to these kids. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The mum did that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The mum did that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This fucking, how, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is some fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some people are not
supposed to be parents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like cartoon villainous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, it's so absurd that
someone can be this fucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean, I saw that,
and I'm just thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my first thought was one, I'm surprised </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it took this long for
something like this to happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This mugshot looks like
she's tore someone's face off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - She looks like a Disney villain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Maleficent just
ripped someone's face off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and stitched it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I shouldn't say that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's probably going too far, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Actually no, fuck you! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You deserve it! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Telling kids to, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That actually looks like she's wearing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> someone else's face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what's more
concerning about that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was someone's parent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Holy fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Imagine being raised by someone like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Holy fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That kid's gonna be fucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But apparently the kid knew nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, the mum did this
without telling the kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She did this by herself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - How would you even tell the kid? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, "Are you cool with this, kid?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "No, I'm not! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Mum, what's wrong with you?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's replying back to a nasty tweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then there's creating deepfakes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Please don't tell my schoolmates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "to go kill themselves and
make deepfakes of them." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I would tell my mum
that I was being bullied, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> she wasn't thrilled about it,
but she was like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm not happy about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'll put in a word to the teacher </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "but you're on your own kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is your problem." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, "I can't deal with this shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't even know what's going on." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, I mean, fucking hell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's scary. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, just so many parts
of the story is actually insane </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that this could happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is literally like a horror movie plot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is kinda like,
it's almost too cartoony </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be a "Black Mirror" episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is, it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if this was a "Black Mirror" episode, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd be like, "Yeah,
twist's really predictable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Really over the top." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like B grade horror film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The mom's kind of an
unbelievable villain here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She could have used more
character development, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> more motivation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, this is reality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But what scares me is that, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what does this mean for the
future of deepfakes now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because like this week especially, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this new app's come up where
it's gotten really easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to deep fake, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Deepfake, you know, use it for memes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> use it for harmless memes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to make people sing fucking Baka Mitai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, we're used to people doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking terrible Photoshops
or doing stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, if someone sent me a video of me doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something I clearly didn't
do or never ever did, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be like, "I don't really give a fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It's fake." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'll say it's fake, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and that'll probably be the end of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But to someone who's never
really had anything online </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or any kind of like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> posted anything about themselves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> outside of their personal Facebook, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can see why receiving a video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that looks like you doing something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you didn't do could
be fucking terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You would think that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> wow, people are really
going to believe this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> even though, you know, realistically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they're probably not going to
if you explain that it's fake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, it's gotten
to a point where like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for people like us especially
where we show our faces </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on camera pretty often, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it wouldn't be hard to
make a convincing deep fake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with, you know, us coming on
camera literally every week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think we all agree on this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that you do not have permission
to make any deepfakes of us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and we don't condone any of
them, by the way, just saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You're legally not allowed to do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, is there anything
legal that's you know, that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you can't, you're not like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I think legally speaking,
you can't like just do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Depending on what jurisdiction you're in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember Tom Scott did a video about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the laws around it are a bit iffy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and obviously stuff
like this always takes- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's such a new thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a really new thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause like, you know, I've seen, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the Baka Mitai deepfakes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, you know, this
is a funny meme or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> But then I don't know how I
would feel if I saw the, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, the KSI Ainsley
Harriott deepfake 'cause- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so good though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's funny as fuck, but then- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also so worrying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Something at the back of my mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which makes me, like,
that's fucking worrying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how good it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm glad it's been
used as a funny meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But my God, if I saw my face
on somebody else like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I would just think, damn, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm glad this is being
used for a funny meme, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but this could be used for
something that's really- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Luckily right now as many
deepfake things are being made, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just as many
things that are detecting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if deepfakes have been made. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, programs that are
being written to detect them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, right now it's like, a
lot of softwares will detect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it is a deepfake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But whether it will get
to the point in the future </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that there is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you think like it's
only a matter of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before we get our first
deepfake cancellation? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I think we're
quite far away from that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think they're still too rough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the technology isn't there yet, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I think it's possible
within like 10 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen some deepfakes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are really fucking convincing though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But, like, the videos are, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> always in like 480p max. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's kind of the
video you would expect for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, like the kind of
phone quality expose videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They're never like 720p 4K. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's always like fuckin'
PlayStation eye camera quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I think the easier
it gets to cancel someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from a deepfake, the less
canceling will happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause everyone will be
like, "It's a deepfake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Is it a deep fake?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or everyone's defense is
gonna be, "It's a deepfake." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But, like, how - </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "That video of me punching a baby? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Deepfake." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - How long until the
deepfake argument is going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to be legitimate? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, the moment that
you can cancel someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a deepfake is when that
argument would come valid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they'll be like, "Oh,
well you saw that deepfake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, it was deepfake." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "It's a really good deepfake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Looks so real! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God, I can't believe it myself." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Our world's going to
become a lot more messy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when it gets there unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, what's scary
is that there's nothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to stop the technology being out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, I guess you can
argue this for a lot of things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember when, you
know, 3D printers became a thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, you can still 3D print guns. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you can still 3D print guns. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You shouldn't, but you can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You shouldn't, and I
believe it's illegal, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, it's most- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The laws around it
are real weird I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think what it is is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that there's most 3D
printing machines can detect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's, like, the blueprint
of a gun or firearm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or something and just not- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well it's like a Photoshop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> If you put a picture
of the dollar bill in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it won't let you do anything to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It'll, like, stop you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had no idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so they don't
want you to Photoshop it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to like try and like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because the software is so powerful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Photoshop is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Print out free money, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Photoshop is a really powerful tool, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the stuff that they
constantly adding to it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just adding to the
repertoire of how strong it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like very concerning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then again, you know, it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when Photoshop first started as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like we were all like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh my God, people are
gonna be like, it's crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Everyone's gonna start getting canceled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "or they're gonna be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "people are gonna put
Nicholas Cage in orgies." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Although that's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that's not unrealistic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bad example. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't remember there being a case </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where someone got in trouble
for a Photoshop picture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, a big story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, because normally, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a picture at least, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there needs to be a lot more context </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> behind why the picture exists </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and without reasonable context of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why the picture would exist, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people aren't really gonna believe it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like it's probably
gonna be the same for a video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, if there's a video
of like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like Robert Downey Jr. just like I said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like, punching a kid in
like a park or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gonna be like, well,
one why is Robert Downey Jr. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a park? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Why is he playing basketball
with a kid then punching him? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The context is gonna be needed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, there's gonna be so many questions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are gonna need to be answered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> before you take a video seriously. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, like, how long until
you do run into like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, perfect
situation where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, the story is there,
the narrative is there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything lines up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The only difference is that
Robert Downey Jr. didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> actually punch the kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But I can make him punch the kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a hoax. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, fuckin' fake news
articles are bad enough already, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, with how, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are fucking
anti-vaxxers and flat earthers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just things that have been enabled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's so easy
to stay in your bubble </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and really like strengthen
your own argument and your own- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a worrying time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is definitely a worrying time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I don't let it get to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm trying to enjoy life, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just trying to live my best life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The world may be ending, but
I'm gonna have a good time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'ma still laugh at these memes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I care about what I need to care about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> No more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's kinda how I like to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I just think that
after a certain point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if you just start
worrying about everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just gonna be fucking miserable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, I think obviously, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're voting on your politician, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, I think you should care about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that should matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like beyond that, do
I care if a news presenter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the US says like
something fucking abhorrent? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, no, honestly
it's not really my problem, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't really give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, maybe that's, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that, like, elitist to think that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Outside of my like, like,
you know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To me like stuff that goes on
in the US sometimes I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "That's honestly not my problem." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, is that bad? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, some people say
that's like a prejudice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or ignorant mindset. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I have the luxury. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It depends on the context, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because the problem is that the problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with that argument I feel is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that there's no way a human can care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about absolutely everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, at some point you're
going to have to pick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and choose what you care about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Otherwise, one, you're probably
gonna be a miserable fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And two, you're gonna wake up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're just gonna be exhausted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and not gonna be able to
do anything in the day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because you just feel flooded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel flooded enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with my own social media right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And this is me, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where social media is so
intertwined with our jobs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I see this stuff and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't care about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure that's how
people become nihilists, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're just like, they
look at the world as like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, the world is shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I guess nothing matters anymore." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it feels like it's
just been so much, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> heavier as well ever since
the pandemic as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you're just trying
to like get by, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Life's already difficult enough
and then shit's going on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, fuck, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I'm literally
just trying to be happy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> for like 10 seconds here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Can I have this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I kind of feel a
bit jealous of our parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they only had to care about the shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was happening around them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Now I have to care about shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's happening halfway across the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, when I see like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my parents are gonna get fuckin' furious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that they changed the bin
size of, like, the council </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by like 10% lower they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh my God, this is unreasonable." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, I just miss the days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where I could give a fuck
about stupid like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Now I've got to worry
about like, literally like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cultural ending stuff.
- Shit that has nothing to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with you, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like, I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I want to care about everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I want to give, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people who are fighting
for like legitimate, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good fights, I want to help them out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But at the same time, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so much fucking shit going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And obviously the internet's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously made all the
information even more accessible, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so there's so many more
things to care about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, all right checking
up on global warming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't waste too much food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's going on over here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's the, there's a civil
war going on in this country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and like atrocities happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> How do I, like, legitimately,
like, give my energy- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're literally just
explaining how to live. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just life, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and like, I don't want to be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Global warming is more important </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "than people dying in this country." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Where do you draw the line
of where to start caring? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think you can, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pick and choose what you care about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's the difference
between being publicly open </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about that stuff, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I wouldn't say I
don't care about something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> as much or, like, oh my God,
this is so tough to talk about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It makes you sound like an asshole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if you say you don't
give a fuck about, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Meilyne, what do you think? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You're our manager. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Will you make sure we don't get canceled? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are we gonna get
canceled for this, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But no, I totally understand
because I feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just part of being human. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, there's gonna be people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that, you know, make the argument, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, you're privileged enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you don't have to care about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, I would argue that surely, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> surely you also can't care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about every single issue
happening in the world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you feel strongly
about this one issue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it definitely affects
you and I understand that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but surely that means that
you can't put the energy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into caring about another issue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think there's any
person out there living any type </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of life, like, you know,
prejudice or not prejudice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> privileged or not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who can deadass be in a
position where it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now everything in the
world I need to worry about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's important to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, it doesn't matter who you are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, there's gonna be one piece of news </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you're just like, "That
has nothing to do with me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Something that resonates with you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you like really believe in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and that you fight
towards like helping that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like I'm down with that, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> At least you're fighting
towards something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That's better than someone just getting up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the morning being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't care about any of this shit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, like, it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't really bother me much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when people get like
angry about, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God, you don't care about this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I hate people who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You don't care enough
about this specific thing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "You should be so
angry about this thing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, man, I am
literally just trying to get by. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What dictates like the
quantitative worth of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how much you care about something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's always some
people who are willing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to get, like, outraged and, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really light a fire up their
ass for something, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, you know, obviously
we need people like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Otherwise shit doesn't get done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't expect
everyone to be like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but then I hate it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I see people, like,
blackmailing other people being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, "You should care more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "You should care so much more about this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the problem with the argument is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that there's no way to
frame it without the person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who, you know, cares less about the topic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no way to frame the argument </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without making them, like, look good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's just, okay,
you don't care about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Therefore you are the asshole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you don't care
about this important issue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like, can we just
accept that we are all human? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We are all just trying to get by. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone has different issues. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some matter more than others, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's a lack of empathy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, we, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in order to empathize with your problem, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you at least have to give us
some empathy as well, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just, like, a lack
of empathy in that sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in that kind of argument. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd like to think if I'm
being ignorant on any of this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that, you know, it won't result in fuckin' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "let's cancel the boys" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but just let me know down below. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I will read the comments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, if I am missing any big point here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or I'm being ignorant,
please do let me know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I would like to change my mindset. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think it's ignorance personally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's just like being honest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I'm exactly the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I try to keep as open-minded
as possible about everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've, you know, I've
definitely changed my viewpoints </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on certain topics thanks
to what people have said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and what's been discussed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was one person who, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I think someone
tweeted at me and was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Connor, you shouldn't
say the word crackhead </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "as like a descriptive word. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "It's a bad word." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it apparently has to
do with a lot of, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like racial stereotyping back
in the war on drugs in America </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff and it's used
as a derogatory term. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I just stopped saying it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That was just 'cause someone
tweeted at me saying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "stop saying it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, well I
don't really need this word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you know, 'cause I
said it a lot on the podcast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, I realized
afterwards I'm like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, there's like way
better ways to describe that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that feeling I was trying to
get across without using that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, yeah, I don't
really need to use that word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't said it since on
like podcast or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I'm like, oh, I haven't said it ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just don't feel the need to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, cool, thanks for
letting me know, commenter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, if I have a bad habit, let me know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll try and get rid of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're like, "Connor, you're fat." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm working on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Other things, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The ones I hate the most are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Connor, you got fatter." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, wow, thanks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's always rough 'cause
that's like, oh my God, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I just feel bad for
people in that situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's rough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Comments be brutal sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Comments really do pick
apart like everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's cool though because
sometimes you miss something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like having a good
balance is the healthy thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you have to find this balance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between knowing that you
can't please everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and finding a balance between, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this person's making a legitimate point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can change my behavior
because, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're making a sound argument
and I completely understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The comment section for the yes-men is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just kind of boring, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, people have that, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever I read comments
about "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it'll be like, "Oh, I fucking hate Joey," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or "I fucking hate Connor." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, well, I mean, I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's like, I guess
we're like characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's all good, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have your favorite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you got your favorite,
it's all good, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But then sometimes they go a
little too far with it, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Man, I wish Connor would just
fuckin' quit the podcast." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, sorry, that's not
gonna happen any time soon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not gonna happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, if it did, do you
think everyone wants that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There are some that are just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Man, I wish Connor would
just deck Garnt in the face." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or other way around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will off camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just like, wow,
is this how friends act? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At least wait 'til the
"Trash Taste" special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where we decide to have a
boxing match or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not that we have anything planned. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Boxing special? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Boxing match confirmed? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Confirmed? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd actually unironically love to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like a YouTuber boxing match </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I just think like, one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Meilyne's like getting ideas right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That multi-million dollar idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish I could bring in multi-million. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like, one, you
get an excuse to train. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You can probably hire a
personal coach, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd probably get in mad shape for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it'd probably be fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd play the villain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd love that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That'd be so much fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But who would I fight though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't got any enemies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I should start beef with someone else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Stop flexing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is not having enemies like
something to brag about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, "Man, Connor, doesn't hate anyone." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I didn't even ask
for enemies and I have enemies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, enemy's a very strong word. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's probably some
people who dislike me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but, like, I don't have any like open beef </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with anyone on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I don't really
fuckin' do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I just kinda just do my own thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, there's a difference
between having YouTuber beef </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and having actual real beef </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you have a big problem with someone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's like, what would you categorize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the KSI Logan Paul stuff? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just pure YouTube beef? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That has to be YouTube beef, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was so over the top. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I don't like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think they hated each other, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think along the
way they started liking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm pretty sure it
started as legitimate beef. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they were like, "Hold on, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "We can make money off this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tens of millions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Hold on, hold the phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I feel like the line is blurred </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where you have a financial
incentive to have beef. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> If they're just like shit talking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can see the light bulb, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> over Meilyne's head right now
just like lighting up, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's like, she has
a POG face right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They made like over like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 20, $30 million each? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause it's not actually beef, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like personal beef about
anything that really matters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, no one told one of their
moms to go fuck themselves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the insults were, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the fuckin' pre-match like beef, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shit talking things were the best part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the boxing matches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were so bad at
talking shit to each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like wrestling levels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Way worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, wrestling has good shit talking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen some wrestling beef
like talking where I'm like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kindergarten insults. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Like, my dad works for Microsoft." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Well, my dad works for Sony." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - "My dad is Nintendo." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "My dad knows Shigeru Miyamoto." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Well my dad is Shigeru Miyamoto." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "My dad's Goku." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just like, yeah, watching, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and if you didn't give a about
any of the YouTube boxing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it was quite entertaining as much as- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was entertaining to watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I paid for the
pay-per-view cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> If he can make this a thing on
YouTube, I'm more than happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I paid for it because I'm
just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You are making entertainment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I fuckin' get that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm watching a clown fiesta, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm paying to watch the circus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'll pay to watch the circus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want more of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think this is great for YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And also for boxing, it did like wonders. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the Renaissance of boxing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - For the people in our age group. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For people who didn't care about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - My dad loves boxing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then my dad's age bracket love boxing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, you know, under
30 and I think mid thirties, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't fuckin' give
a shit about boxing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A lot of people don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I'm sure there's
a good segment of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who probably love boxing
and MMA and all that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it wasn't like nearly as popular </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> as it used to be with
our age group, at least. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause boxing was like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the most classic moments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in sports are boxing matches, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like anything like "Rumble in the Jungle," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know. anything with Muhammad Ali. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Iconic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuckin' iconic to this day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, I grew up in an era </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where I didn't even watch any
boxing match, I don't think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't watch boxing matches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think I've ever sat down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and watched a boxing match in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I watched 'cause my
dad loved watching it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he'd be like, "Man, this
guy is fighting this guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "for the world heavyweight." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Who are these people?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause if you're a kid and
your parents weren't into it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then how the fuck can you afford
to watch the pay-per-view? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, there's no way you could watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's always in American time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, it's always at like 3:00 AM. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you had to pay for like Sky, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which was already like 40 pounds a month, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and you pay an extra 20 pounds on top </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get the pay-per-view. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just, yeah, it was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, what do you
think about the whole, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if this is
changing gears too fast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but what do you think
about the whole thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where everyone's like, man,
they're ruining like boxing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by bringing in these influencers to it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's happened with chess as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - By bringing in these,
like, non-traditional- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, you bring in, like,
you know, you kind of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess the way they would argue is, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're diluting, like, the sport. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't understand how putting more eyes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> onto a sport ruins it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because the whole point of
keeping a sport alive is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that a sport is kept alive
by how many viewers watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, there's a side of
it where I can understand, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, you know, for chess, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at least, you know what,
if you start at age 12, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you're like 30 now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're a Grandmaster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You've literally been playing
your whole life for chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're about to, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is your time to shine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then fuckin' PogChamps
has like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 20, 30 times more viewers than
anything you ever will get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could understand why they're mad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That just sounds like
a villain protagonist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to some sports anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, I understand why- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - A bit of backstory to some sports anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's super easy to understand
why they would get mad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then, you know, if you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a YouTube video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I make a YouTube video
and I'm a small YouTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about this Mike Wazowski figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then Garnt who has,
you know, a million, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say Garnt has 3 million. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And a YouTuber with 10,000 makes a video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about Mike Wazowski. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt pretty much does like
nearly a one for one video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, but in Garnt's style, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yes, that guy will be angry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Garnt just made my video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "but to a bigger audience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "He's going to get all the views." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What you're not seeing is a huge kick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you're going to get a
bunch of trickle-down views, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's what's gonna
happen with all the stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, you're not gonna see
the immediate results of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, getting the trickle down effect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from all these massive
events with like normies, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you will. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, but I think the problem is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that most of these "purists" don't see it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> as a trickle down effect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They just see it as like sloppy seconds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, well they see it as like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're ruining the sanctity of my sport. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "I wanted all
the guys to come to me first." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But you know, it's, you know, again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more eyes, more sponsor money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's all good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, I think we
talked about this, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two weeks ago where you have
to evolve with the times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And you have to find a way to
garner interest in your sport. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Keep up or get left behind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, you
know, sports like boxing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and chess are lucky that
they've had such a good history </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and a good legacy where that has, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of carried them a
bit in the modern age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they have like a solid fan base. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But obviously, you know,
if they want to modernize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to a point where they want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to bring in a bunch of new
viewers, you got to mix it up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And chess is having like
a massive Renaissance now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's huge.
- Yeah, I'm happy for chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, chess streamers the biggest one's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Hikaru's pulling in like
plus 25K I think a stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, and a bunch of the
other bigger ones pulling in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like, over 5K viewers
on Twitch which is nuts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, you know, just
because you're, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> pulling new viewers I feel
like that doesn't, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> dilute the history that
has already been built. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, people are still gonna look back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to, like, the greats of the
time once they get into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's still the
greats going on right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just people don't like
that they're not the ones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are solely being talked about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I think one of the
big things is that I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, I might
be talking out my ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it seems like a lot of the
younger generations are less, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's less of a focus on sports, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and more people are like
getting into, like, video games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, we literally talked
about how my nephew got bullied </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he wanted to play sports </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but everyone was playing Fortnite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas when I was growing up- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The other the way around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was the other way around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The cool kids were playing sport, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's why sports had
such, like, so many eyes on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now I think because less
kids might be interested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in sports, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to find a new way to
appeal to a younger audience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Otherwise they're just
not gonna give a shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is gonna sound weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I think that video games are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> now more accessible than sports. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's why they're doing better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, if you want to play a
game of rugby or football, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, at least five a side. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You need a lot of people to get that done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And a lot of space. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, a lot of space. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, anyone can play a video
game on their smartphone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever, and anyone
can download chess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyone can play Madden. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like, it's like, you
know, a lot of the sports, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I love swimming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like finding a swimming
pool in Japan is so hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, without paying out the ass, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and there's not
one anywhere near us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, I don't
fuckin' know where to go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, there's like
gyms that have them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you have to pay, like, 150
bucks a month to access them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, most sports that I liked as a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I realized how lucky I
was that there was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the UK you have so many
sports centers all around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can do this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but now I'm like, it's
so hard to do the sports </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that I want to do and get into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want to get back into sports. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And get like a newer
generation into them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's like, I mean,
I'm not being funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How are you gonna convince
a kid to go play golf </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> when he can play Mario golf? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so accessible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the problem is golf looks so boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sorry, but golf, like, I can not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There are some sports where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do not understand how
people can watch this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be entertained because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, I've played golf before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like I used to like live
kind of near a driving range </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just, so I had a period </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I just really enjoyed playing golf. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was really satisfying
to like smack the ball. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Wasn't rich enough to afford
my own golf clubs, so (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Another barrier to entry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's my barrier to entry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's really fun to play golf. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> My God, it's so boring to watch! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can not watch a golf game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I'm sure the
people who are watching this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> who love watching golf, and
I'm sorry to disappoint. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, like, there's so many
sports like that though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I used to play tennis like a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But I can not sit down
and watch a tennis match. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I don't know, I can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some games are so good though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But they are long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They are long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They are very long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I find it just so weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and interesting how, like, I
myself love playing the sport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and yet I can't bear to sit
down and watch the sport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you'd think if
someone played the sport, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they would be just as
interested to watch it as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, not always. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because the inverse is also true as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I might, like, have no
interest in playing the sport, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but I love watching it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's more common I feel.
- Like, Garnt with League. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like me with League. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that a sport? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Ooh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ooh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, I mean, like
for example, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's always gonna be,
like, massive sports, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like football. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not gonna go away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's, like, too deeply ingrained. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I feel like that's why the
Olympics are so weird to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you end up watching
a load of these sports </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which you would in any other
circumstances have no interest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in watching, but it's the Olympics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Does anyone want to watch
like men's volleyball? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never gave a shit about archery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until I watch it in the Olympics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are a lot of
sports that are interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when you have them or you experience them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once every four years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And your country's kind of in the race. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you gotta a horse
to root for, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, I don't think
archery week by week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Monday night archery, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, you gotta build storylines. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You gotta build up characters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Olympics definitely opened my eyes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to, like, some sports being really- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, handball. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I never fuckin' saw handball before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, curling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I fucking love watching curling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Curling is fun to watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never thought I'd be into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is hype as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Curling is like a Mario Party game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that actually turned into a real sport. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a mini game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But, like, every round is curling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally, by accident. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "Let's just
fucking make it real." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's one sport I really want to play, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like try out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Is there like a sport
that you've never done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you want to try? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Speed ice skating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It looks so cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That seems so dangerous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought of that 'cause there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> somebody who watches "Trash
Taste" reached out to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on Twitter, and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they were verified and
they had like 1,000 followers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Sports? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they were a pro
ice skater in like America? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Canada? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're like, "Yeah,
I love Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they were on the Olympic team. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For like ice skating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And they watched us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I think ice skating is real cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Real cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Teach me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Nah, I love ice skating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd love to like go fast and do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's too dangerous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's dangerous as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd slam my face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd have to, like, get
past that mental barrier </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of just like, you know when
you reach a certain speed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and especially if you're not used to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to get past that
barrier of just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm going a bit too fast now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "If I fall, it's really gonna hurt." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what Olympic
sport I want to exist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but will never exist is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when you go
to like Round One here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get the Zorb ball around you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like football where
you're wearing, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the balls where you can
just run into each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That'd be such a fun Olympic sport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Imagine just like 18 people on the field </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just fucking crashing into each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly if you ever come
to Japan, come to Round One </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause most Round One have this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're gonna see it on screen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's spo-cha, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's spo-cha yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you're gonna see it on screen now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You can easily get access to this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, they're everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] And then a lot
of Round Ones in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] They had like BB gun shooting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, it's surprisingly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember when we did it
right in the fuckin' summer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which was a fuckin' stupid move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right after we had like
the biggest bowl of curry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were like, we were
in the fuckin' Zorb ball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like rolling around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're just like, "Oh, I'm gonna throw up." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's surprisingly, it was surprisingly- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We should go back there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We haven't been there in so long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was surprisingly fucking
tiring to do that though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It looks really light
to just run around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, it's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is kinda like playing
a Mario Party game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like, it feels like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you're playing football </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's got this like
really janky physics engine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like trying to drive
a car in like Cyberpunk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Custom game mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, big head mode where
you're just fuckin' top heavy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's literally Gang Beast controls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd love that to be a sport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you guys gonna go watch
any of the Olympic sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it happens this year? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How the fuck do I apply? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Supposedly now that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's been confirmed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that they're not gonna
bring any foreigners in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So, but, you can go see it at the stadium </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which means there's gonna
be way more available seats </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the actual Olympics. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I kind of want to do it just because like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you know how to get tickets? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna look into it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have no idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because, like, if I can find it out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> then I'd want to go just to say I've been. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the only time I've
ever seen tickets available, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the only way you could win
it was by buying something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> from Panasonic and you get
entered into a lottery. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which of maybe you'll
get the right to buy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that sounds like a very Japanese- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds like a Japanese thing to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't wanna buy Panasonic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I want a ticket to the Olympics. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because this would be the second time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've lived in a city
where the Olympics was held </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was there for London. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wasn't there in London. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You weren't there in London? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was in Wales at that time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, yeah, I was living
in London at the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, I mean, I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> During the normal Olympics
things just, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get super, super busy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't really like
crowds that much anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, like, I didn't want to go
through the hassle of going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a sporting event. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't care enough about
the sport for me to want to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to this big sporting event where I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, I literally just said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Olympics is where you watch sports </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you normally don't care about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you watch it 'cause it's the Olympics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I don't even know what
sports I would want to watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I feel like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would you just want to watch any sport? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But also, what if you watch a sport, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like a bad game,
like it's a bad matchup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a stomp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It'd be like America versus
like Venezuela in basketball. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it's like, oh, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Obviously Venezuela's gonna crush. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Obviously, obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I feel like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> With those kinds of stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel it's just you go to
just enjoy the atmosphere, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause like I remember- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How many have you been? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never been to the Olympics, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, how would you know
the atmosphere's good? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, well, I mean every
other sporting event I've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to has been, 'cause, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember I went to go watch, like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like Japanese
atmosphere though in a crowd, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're not very rowdy, are they? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I went to go see the baseball here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was really, really fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it was a shit game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What was fun about it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I say this having been to
a baseball game in the US </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I kind of found it a bit boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You don't love the kiss cam, Garnt? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel, okay, okay,
this might be a bit biased </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I actually quite
enjoy watching the baseball </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every now and then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I also don't enjoy cricket either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just making an enemy of, like, the US, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Australia, India now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who else? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - All the sports. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They all suck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, well, 'cause, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I went to go watch a rugby game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like I'm not
huge into the rugby, but- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Watching rugby games is fun though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, on the TV. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, and in person. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went to go watch the
rugby, and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it was a shit game 'cause our
team got fuckin' destroyed, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I still had a really fun time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just because of the atmosphere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, everyone's rowdy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but baseball was
the same thing as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, my team was losing, but
I didn't really give a fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it was just, I don't
know, it was just fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause like how we
had fun was just getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> very, very drunk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was in Milwaukee- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's typically what you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like everyone was just very drunk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "I don't know what the fuck's going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm having a good time now
though 'cause I'm pretty drunk." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Yes, please, another Miller Lite." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Yes, I'll pay for another
eight dollar hot dog." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Oh, yes, this hot dog that
is not meat, I'll have that." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I just like having an active
component to my sport, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How can I say this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't like when sports are stop starts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I like it to be, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you're not into like the NFL? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, bro, watching NFL is hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The amount of ads they have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, it's also very
stop start heavy game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, I feel like the NFL is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can get into the NFL </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because when the game is in motion, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, it's hard to find a
sport as exciting as the NFL </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when everything is in motion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt's winning over
our American audience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's so many things going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in such a short period of time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas, you know, I look
at something like cricket </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or baseball and there's
only, you know, there's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's very stop start heavy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very stop, start, and
there's, you know, there's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna sound like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sound so bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just, I just see like
a guy trying to hit a ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you prefer
American football or rugby? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ooh, it's hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think rugby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Overall I prefer rugby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I've had more exciting, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> moments watching American football. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel then you would really enjoy AFL. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's AFL? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Australian football. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's basically like NFL except- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't know Australia had- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If we're representing our own country, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to talk about AFL </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause someone's gonna talk about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But AFL is basically like it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's Australian football,
but think of NFL, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if it was just one continuous
play that never stopped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, that sounds pretty fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like twice
the field size as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sounds exhausting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> AFL players are legitimate athletes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like they- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How do they do that in Australian heat? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - As opposed to like every other sport. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I saw something which is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in an average AFL game,
a player can run upwards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of like 20 kilometers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's a two hour game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they split it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I bet they made that game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that long on how long
Australians need to drink. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Another round." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why AFL games are
the best to watch at home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like two hours of drinking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck yeah, dude! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 30 minute recess, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but I think you'd really like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you don't like the
start stop aspect of NFL, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think you'd really like AFL. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I do like a lot of sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where like there's a lot of
things in motion, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Love football, love watching basketball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I went to Canada, I
loved watching the hockey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hockey's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I could really get into hockey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hockey was fuckin' fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hockey's really fun to watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So fast paced. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a sport where I think watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that, like, live would
be super, super fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd love to watch that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, the atmosphere
just looks super, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And in the back of your head, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Ooh, this might turn into a fight." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sadly I've never lived anywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's, like, a popular sport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which is so sad 'cause I want to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But every time when I went to Canada, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was, like, literally like I
was watching it all the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to go and watch one
next time I go to Canada </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, see, I said something
nice about America for once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I got an angry email that was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the subject was "please
educate yourself on America." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Something like, "You talk
about America all the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "but you always get everything
wrong in our culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Totally incorrect." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I should find it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I deleted it though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I was like, shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What about, like, Sumo? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sumo? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ooh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I really want to go watch Sumo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that would be fun to watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't watch enough
Sumo to have an opinion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or haven't tried to watch enough Sumo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have an opinion about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone in my Twitch chat notified me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that there's a Twitch channel
that streams the Sumo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, with English commentary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like every now and then when it's on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just kind of flick it on,
and leave it in the background </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> while I'm working 'cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, don't even have to turn my TV on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's on Twitch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's fucking great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever, like, gotten
into a sport or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of a show you watched or an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause, like, the only reason
I gave the NFL a chance was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause of fuckin' "Eyeshield." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I sound like such a weeb for saying this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm just like, okay, I'm
gonna give the NFL a chance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mine's even worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I got into tennis 'cause
of "Prince of Tennis." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Deadass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got into like cycling
from "Yowamushi Pedal." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you actually? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's fuckin' hype. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, I found the email. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey Connor, love the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "But if you could do me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "and the rest of American fans a favor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "could you please stop
throwing misconceptions around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "about us? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Maybe educate yourself a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "on how we do things here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "instead of believing
the typical stereotypes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's almost every podcast
now you say something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "about America that's completely false </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "and only applies to 1% of
us and is just annoying." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish they gave examples,
so I could be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, that's fair." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Are we wrong about things
most of the time, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot if it's right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of it's right apparently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here's the problem with America, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait, wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Go on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, there's many problems. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Something that applies to
one state does not apply </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to another state. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause America is fuckin' huge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so varied, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, Meilyne, do you not think of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you feel very different
to other states, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you don't feel like
you have anything in common </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with people from like Florida, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, so like someone from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I can relate to someone
from any part of the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I can understand everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I understand how you live. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, everything's the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But for like someone in like California, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't possibly relate completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to someone from like Minnesota. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Totally different culture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Totally different vibe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shut up, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, there's so many, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it's so vast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's so many different,
like, micro-cultures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like, definitely like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whenever I go visit
Sidney's family in Milwaukee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Wisconsin, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's definitely a
Midwestern culture that's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> From traveling the US you realize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how different they all view
each other as Americans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, it's completely different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So fuck you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He did say he was a big
fan of the podcast though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you guys seen
any, like, obscure sport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you, like, that you only know about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's been recommended
on YouTube or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then like, it actually
looks pretty fuckin' hype? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, there was one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot what it was,
but I think it's, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> an Indian sport or a Southeast Asian sport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's volleyball,
but you kick the ball. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck is it called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sepaktakraw. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sepaktakraw. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally just think of volleyball, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, you know how with volleyball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you pass it with your hands. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But instead of your hands, you kick it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Isn't that just football tennis? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Kinda. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't say that, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every sepaktakraw player's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "How dare you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "How dare you ruin the
sanctity of our sport?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that sounds cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, have you seen stuff
like professional tag </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Professional tag is fuckin' awesome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, Vox did a video about
how it came to be as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did it come to be? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just a guy who was like really obsessed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with the idea of making like tag courses. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just kept, like, building them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and people were like, "Yo,
this is pretty fun actually." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what's one obscure
sport I really enjoy watching? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Ultimate frisbee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a really fuckin'- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] That's really fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In the US I think it's quite popular? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like Marques Brownlee plays it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, he plays it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it an Olympic sport? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not, is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not an Olympic sport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He mentioned it quite a
lot though in his videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's shared videos of him playing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Pretty cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess outside of America,
it's not really like a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I remember we
played it for, like, sports </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once for school, and it was really fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, we played
it in school as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it was definitely a thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was more seen of just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It sounds like the
most college sport ever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ivy League past time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I have the luxury of being able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "to play ultimate frisbee."
- "Ultimate frisbee." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Yes." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the ultimate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the ultimate that like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, why ultimate? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We don't have ultimate football. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> We do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What if they called
it like epic frisbee? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd be playing it right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Would you like to join
our epic frisbee team?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the kind of sport
you'd think you'd see on Twitch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Epic frisbee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I could see
ultimate frisbee on Twitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why not? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That'd be fuckin' awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, POV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - POV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're a frisbee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - POV you're an ultimate frisbee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I feel like Twitch
would be the perfect platform </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a lot of these more obscure sports, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like professional arm wrestling as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you seen that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like the most dude
bro sport I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the slapping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Moist Critikal loved to commentate on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, what I love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> about watching professional
arm wrestling is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that, like, they're egging
each other on to do better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's almost like a gym session </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like, "You got this, bro! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You got this, bro!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually, you know what the best one is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I decided this is the best one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The best sport you've seen
on the internet three times, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> forget about, but remember is badass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the like Sumo, but
with the, like, robot wars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a Sumo ring with like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they have like mini robots, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they have to push each other out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's from where the
omae wa mou shindeiru, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like that really popular
edit where it like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's such a good video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Play a gif. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] omae wa mou shindeiru. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (man yells) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what was that show? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Robot Wars." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, but America did a version of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "BattleBots" that's it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that clip is from a Japanese- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - From the Japanese one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where they do it with miniature ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause the "BattleBots" and
"Robot Wars" in the UK were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like fuckin' giant robots. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - These ones are like tabletop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's not meant to destroy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's supposed to push the other thing out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's pretty cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Really fuckin' cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's nothing getting
destroyed, I am not interested. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - My man monkey brain not
happy, no destruction. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I kinda miss "Robot Wars." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know when it got canceled. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it still a thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's probably not still a thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think it's
still a thing anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think "BattleBots"
is still a thing either. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Meilyne, check that out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's one of the few
things we had growing up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that made engineering look cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it's really hard to
make engineering look cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you see these like mechanics- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That would be like a really cool way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to teach engineering, coding,
like all in one thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Get them to make just a
little thing fuckin' move </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around a little bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, why not teach that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one thing I loved
about "BattleBots" though was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like, just the fluctuation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between like the different people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who clearly had completely
different skills in engineering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, one robot was, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this robot has an automated
arm that can, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grab and pick up robots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there's another dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the challenger comes in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "I attached
60 knives onto this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "And the only function
it can do is go forwards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "and backwards." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a chainsaw on wheels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Literally it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you see it like
some like piddly robots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that had like the most
depressing flipper of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, couldn't even flip my grandma, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it goes up against
like fuckin' Hypno-Disc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something and just
gets absolutely destroyed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Half of them, like, don't
even move in practice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So, it's just a doorstopper on wheels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then like, I don't know
if "BattleBots" had this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but the UK one had this where, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the showrunners had their
own, like, OPS robots </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that would just like when
the nothing was happening, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they'd be like, "Send out
Charles" or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Send out Sir Killalot." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then like this just fucking massive, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> clearly like absolutely god
tier engineering robot came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, created by NASA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just started like gorilla
smashing them around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like, oh, that's
kind of anticlimactic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] Apparently
"BattleBots" was supposed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to come back in 2020, but it's postponed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, wow.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "BattleBots" is coming back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When did "BattleBots" end? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So wow, two thousands it
ends, it's coming back soon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just getting reminded of all, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> these old television shows I
used to watch as a kid now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you remember "Gladiators?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Was that a part of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's very, very old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like 90s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds really familiar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> What is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's basically like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Very much inspired,
like, the whole, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of sporty-esque, like,
really intense physical sports. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was kind of like, instead of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> instead of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what are like the shows
that like Fall Guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff is based around? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Wipeout." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So instead of, like, going
against an obstacle course, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'd have an obstacle course, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then you'd be competing
against a gladiator </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> which was like this kind of, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really fit muscular person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there would be this
competitive element </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you'd have to beat, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> beat this person on this obstacle course, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or you'd have to just,
like, literally fight them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the final hurdle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get to the end,
he's just standing there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, the best way I can describe it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's basically something very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like "Wipeout" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with wrestling basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's, like, real time,
like, you're fighting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> well, not fighting but like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, there's like one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think there's one
event in it where, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you both have, like, the long poles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with like the cushions on the end, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you fuckin' have to
smack each other off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yes, yes, I remember that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically giant cotton buds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Try to push each other off the platform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I remember that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know that show is old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I think when I was
watching that like very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> early 2000s everyone was
wearing like latex and spandex. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, oh yeah- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure all that's just taken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from "Takeshi's Castle," right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, what was the other one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The Japanese one was called, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was, it's called, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Ultimate Banzuke" or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You heard of this one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where like, literally they will do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this show is so fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You should watch clips on YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really fuckin' cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, what they would do is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they would have like someone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> either they would be a generic thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or they'd have an expert. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, they bring on like
10 expert pogo people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they would build, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a fuckin' impossible pogo obstacle course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they would have to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, like, the shit
they would do is insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It wasn't just general people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like, no, they get professionals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there'll be people who
like, they'd have to be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they bring people who are
professionals at like handstands, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they'd have to do a whole course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> handstand walking around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, going upstairs, going on wobbly- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I've definitely seen that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really fucking cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You should watch this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just type it in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's, I'll have to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Ultimate Banzuke," right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And, like, the stuff
they had to do was crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, they had that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that Mario Party game
where you have to, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like seven things stacked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you have a hammer and hit it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They had a game where
two people had to do that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they had to like, hit them all out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But obviously when you hit it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it would like tip the thing over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was really cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's based off like a
traditional Japanese, like, toy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was pretty cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's like the best concept of, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a reality TV program that you've seen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, physical game show challenge? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like "Ninja Warrior." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The original, the Japanese original. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Sasuke." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that was really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was this really
old reality TV show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that Channel Four made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember the name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it was, like, a one-off series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I always remember it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I thought the concept was genius. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because what they did is this was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this was way back when
when "Big Brother" was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, a massive thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the twist was, they
took these group of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that weren't exactly the
brightest bunch of people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but, you know, wanted to
be on a reality TV show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they would basically, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they basically convinced them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they were going to go to space. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I think I remember this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So what happens is they literally go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they literally, like, take
them astronaut training. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And make them go through all the training, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also feed them like a
bit of fake information. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because they had this real mock spaceship, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they taught them that, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we are using new technology </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it doesn't require rockets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of like an
airplane where it, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slowly circles up to
the Earth's atmosphere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And these guys would believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They thought they were, like,
being trained in Russia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was the name of the show? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna have to look it up
because it was a genius show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, like, at any point, if like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at any point one of them
could have found out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they were, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the producer said, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna be trained in Russia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not gonna be in England. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And what happened is they
just took them on a plane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just, like, circled round </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just landed in like an
abandoned airfield in Surrey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, they were just, like,
in the middle of England </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking they were going to space. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they actually took
some of these people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just, have you ever been on like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of those fake rollercoaster rides? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where it's like, it's kinda like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, the 4D ones? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like the 4D ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where, you know, you just kind
of, like, have this spaceship </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that just kind of tilts up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's called "Space Cadets." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Aired in 2005 on Channel Four. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Channel Four normally does
all the really bizarre, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really unique game shows in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you got, like, if you
got some time you want to kill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's honestly, it was
such a good concept. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was a one off as
well, one off season. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sounds hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was fuckin' hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Highly recommend it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the first thing that comes up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you Google it is like controversies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It must be quite controversial. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want to watch that now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That sounds awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that sounds really funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The UK has some pretty unique game shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the hunted one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the hunted one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The hunted one was cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically there's a game show in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was literally called "Hunted." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they would have, like, I
think six pairs or 10 pairs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something around that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and basically what they
would do is they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, you have like one day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we're gonna
start trying to, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> track you as if you're a fugitive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, like any of your, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you use your phone, if you do anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you make calls, you go to
places, like they'll find you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so some people were really good at it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and some people are terrible at it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they had to survive two weeks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, two weeks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Two weeks, and then go
to a location to get, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a plane to, like, to escape. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, well, one team did win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds really fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was really cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was really popular the first season, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the second season I
think was a bit shitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and didn't do too well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel that's a concept, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at first that would be
like, wow, that's cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But then I feel it'd get old quite fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because there's
only so much you can do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> once you know the formula and
once you know the secrets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's something like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the logistics behind that
must've been like crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I wonder how much of
that was faked though as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you surely can't
have access to all the, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the police force's like ability, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's just a waste of
police time and services. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's just a lot of government money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Hold on, wait, we've
gotta find the fake one." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wonder. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like in a concept, really cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Was that on Channel Four as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was on Channel Four as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Channel Four made some
good, like, one-off reality- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm surprised I never
heard of any of these. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Channel Four makes
really good TV shows in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like, some of my
favorite are definitely, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the Derren Brown specials. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how famous Derren
Brown is outside of the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right now probably not so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Never heard of him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've never heard of Derren Brown? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some of the shit this man did was crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> His favorite thing that he's ever done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So Derren Brown is a magician from the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's a magician that basically like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hypnotist as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sorry? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, a hypnotist as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't remember exactly
what he calls himself, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but he's more like a
mental magician where- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mentalist? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not even like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Something about the word
mentalist makes it sound fake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This man is just one of a kind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like, he's a showman. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He says, like, "Everything I do is," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, it's not so much that it's fake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like it's, there
is like magic involved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He doesn't claim to have special powers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He just claims to understand
psychology and plays on that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so there's this
one TV show that he did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it is literally my favorite, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's so big brain, this whole thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'll spoil the end of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'll warn you I'm gonna do that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'll spoil it for you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's still cool either
way, if you watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So, what happens is this TV show starts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're following this
perspective of this one woman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This one's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so basically what happens is is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so the show is that he, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> basically he knows
which horse is gonna win </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in these horse races. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, the exact name of the
special is called "The System." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, the way he markets it
is that he has a system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that can 100% predict
which horse is going to win </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a horse race. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And so it's like this middle-aged woman </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you know, we follow her. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He calls her up, he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Listen, bet on this horse, go now." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So she goes and she bets on it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the cameras are following her. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> She bets on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She wins. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, oh, shit, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he rings her up again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Right now, put all of your
money on this horse now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, a week later. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she puts all the money on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She wins again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How is he doing this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is legit, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a fully legitimate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's, like, a public gambling
that anyone can bet on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a real horse race. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He gives them the money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He gives them a thousand pounds, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's been a while, but, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no, I don't think he gives them any money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So anyway, she wins
and it happens again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, "All right, now, bet again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "All the money on this horse." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She does it again, and she wins. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think it's one more time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, "All right,
now this is the final one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Bet all of your money on this again." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she wins. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're like, what
the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, he's literally guessing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he reveals,
and as the episode ends </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that like he's literally done
like a tournament bracket </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like, every single
race there's nine horses. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, every single race he's
literally found nine people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and told them to bet on
the different horses. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's literally gone through
and done like a giant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, hundreds of races. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a pyramid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So, like at the beginning he started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like thousands of
thousands of contestants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he said, you know, I, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he didn't reveal who his identity was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was just like an anonymous tip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so, you know, part of, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> certain amount of people
won, they got eliminated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> He gave them a refund, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then he went up to the next bracket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he kept, he basically
kept enough of a group </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of people to make sure there
was at least one person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's so simple. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But when you're following the story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and her perspective, it
seems like literal magic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the message he
was trying to say was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't forget about perspective. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just because you are winning
doesn't mean that, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't mean like there's a magical system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all to do with probability. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds right up my alley. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, he's literally a fuckin' genius. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> His shows are amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, he did one where,
he's done so many crazy shows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think one of my
favorite ones is, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ones where he actually
faked a zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that sounds familiar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I might've seen that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So basically he takes this one guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So how he gets people in his specials is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that people apply to be on his specials. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But he doesn't tell anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they've succeeded.
- What it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He doesn't tell anyone
that they've succeeded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So he gets thousands and
thousands of applicants, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he chooses one out of everyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, he takes this guy and he puts, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he basically hypnotized
him, so he like passes out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he wakes up in this
like abandoned hospital. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you know, it's basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just this guy going through
a zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, the "Truman Show." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they get everyone around him to act </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and go along as if there's
a zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So this guy literally believes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that there's like a zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think this is on Netflix as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So, you can actually
watch this on Netflix. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's another one where he sees </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if he can convince
someone to commit murder. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, fake murder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He sets up the situation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That one's not as good as the other ones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like, they all vary in quality, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you're definitely
gonna have an experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You definitely can't
find anything like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the name of the show again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just type in Darren Brown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Derren, Derren. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Derren Brown? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - D-E-R-R-E-N. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But he's done a lot of stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - His live shows are
really popular as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been to his live shows actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Does like a lot of psychology things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> He basically like
manipulates like perception. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really just interesting stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it gives you a lot of perspective, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he, you know, he goes in saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, all of this is just magic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like he, a lot of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - None of this is magic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sorry? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You said all of this is magic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "So I'm just a fuckin' magician. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You guys know me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hogwarts diploma right here." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, 'cause like watching his stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> he doesn't pretend to be, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he doesn't pretend like he has powers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all showmanship- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's how British people like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that's my favorite type of musician, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> magician. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, fuckin', </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - David Blaine? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, not David Blaine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Penn and Teller. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I like about Penn and Teller </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "We're not fuckin' magicians. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "We're just good at what we do." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all just slight
of hand shit, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Unlike, you know, like fuckin' Chris Angel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> who's like, "Yes, I am the
second coming of Christ." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I'm literally fucking dying." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I literally die." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be fair, every now
and then I love going back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and watching like Chris
Angel clips on YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because, like, I
remember back in the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I watched, like,
Chris Angel being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, I split this woman in half." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like,
oh my God, this man is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's actually a magician. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This man is insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's like, "Yes, I'm walking on water." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's totally not just, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> see-through fuckin'
plastic boards on the pool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Were you around when David Blaine did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that stunt in London where he would like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Stayed in the cage? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, stayed in the cage
or something for like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> how long did he stay in there for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A month wasn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was a long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like a month without
any food or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember just thinking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there were so many
moments during that month </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where he just got fucking
shit on by all, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fuckin' chavs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like it was back in
the time when, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> England had this nice
prim and proper image </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to Americans, especially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you just had, like,
these fuckin' people, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these Londoners who were just
chucking paint balls at him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and shit like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt so bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Chavs in London are
a different breed, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Man, it, just like as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like when I saw that he's like
staying in there for 30 days, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is the record really worth it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I get it, like, the stunt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, is this fun? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I guess the fact that
we're still talking about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to this day is worth it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess that's the point, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I just lose a month of my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to get a bit of clout. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be talked about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's the ultimate clout chaser. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This shit's very impressive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He could probably kill me
with magic for all I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Make a frog come out of my ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shitting out frogs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you seen his Ted Talk? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He had a Ted Talk, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like breaking down how
he did one of his stunts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> which was like how he stayed under water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like broke the world record. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that was cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, like, he was going
through the process of, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they tried a load of different things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, they tried stuffing, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a airbag into his stomach to
give him like a breathing tube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Isn't that just cheating? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's magic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That just ended up horribly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then they just kind of, like,
tried a lot of different ways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see if this was possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, like, the conclusion
they came to was just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's just fuckin' do it properly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, he- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's just, you know, train. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, let's just almost drown myself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's basically what he did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this man has just monetized
being fuckin' mental, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's a true mentalist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, it's respectable that he did that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he achieved that, like,
all the credit to him, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but my God, you must- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the magic of willpower. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's all it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the fucking craziest
people that do, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the fuckin' like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> most absurd shit.
- Dumbest shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That, like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to be a little
bit crazy to be a genius, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I think there
has to be a little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, what was that quote again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a genius is
just an insane person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with an audience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know who said that
quote, but it's a quote. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just, my God, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like going back to the caving stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we spoke about a few weeks ago, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it has to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's gotta be some dopamine
deficiency going on here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that requires you to like, need to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I have a good meal and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> damn, that dopamine hit was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Someone has like a seven 11, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, no, I gotta fuckin'
climb the building instead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I gotta climb the seven 11 to get a hit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're like, what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> What's going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Fear Factor?"
- What's "Fear Factor?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, "Fear Factor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I mean- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Didn't that have a lot of
controversy, "Fear Factor?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I've seen- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, Joe Rogan did it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it's either like,
you can eat your own shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or drink your own piss. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not even that bad though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I remember, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I saw one episode or one season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where, like, the final gross </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever the fuck it was called, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like the worst
meal was, it was balut. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was balut which
is, like, the duck fetus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they eat in, like, the Philippines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause when I went to the
Philippines for the first time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Aki was like, "Do you wanna try balut?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "What the fuck is that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "It's a duck fetus." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was the worst thing
they had on "Fear Factor." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I ate it and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people on "Fear Factor"
are fuckin' pussies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get Joey on "Fear Factor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's something weird
about the fact of being like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, this is delicious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What are you on about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can just imagine someone
went to the Philippines, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then someone really politely is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is our culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is what we eat." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, "I can't wait
to put this on Fear Factor! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "People are gonna eat this!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's so weird about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, I understand like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> eating cockroach or something
right where it's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Something that shouldn't be eaten. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Something that shouldn't be eaten- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And isn't really widely
eaten by any culture, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of like, I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, you know- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then there's taking,
like, an obscure food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from like a cultural background. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, "This is
disgusting, isn't it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Look how vile this is! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Someone's gonna eat this shit!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Someone's gonna eat this shit!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Meanwhile everyone in the
Philippines is like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Philippine audience
is like Mike Wazowski. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's either McDonald's or this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are they really gonna
waste that balut like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm Thai, and Thai people eat water bugs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I don't stand by that shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I still haven't forgotten, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I still have not forgotten. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're not gonna like go and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Mom, can I take some water bugs back? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm filming Fear Factor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "This is crazy!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Nobody eats this!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Sarah has a choice
between jumping off a bridge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "or eating a bug. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "She chose to jump off a bridge." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is "Fear Factor?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never watched it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Isn't it you get two choices? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, am I crazy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it two choices? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> No, I think- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't fuckin' give
a shit, it's garbage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just a show where it's, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> contestants basically
line up and being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if you eat this, then you
go onto the next round. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you survive the entire round, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get a prize money
or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like the food or what
you have to do is, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> usually considered gross
according to Americans at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Vegetables. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna get shit after. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The first step- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay, now the email is warranted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll give you that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, fair enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what meme with that kid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> who's just got vein popping out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor when he hasn't shit
on America for 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - True, true, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Hey, I think it's fair fuckin' game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't see me fuckin'
emailing Americans being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Stop making British memes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't say the word eight." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Be a little bitch and take your shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We all get mocked, okay, it's 2021! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, "Fear Factor." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Spinach or carrots." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Who the fuck eats celery?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Celery without hummus." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Americans, I don't actually believe this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm joking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a joke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> This is a bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Eat the celery or take
the hummus and go home." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, but basically it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to do something
gross or eat something gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you decide to do it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> then you move onto the next round. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> If you don't decide to do
it, then you get kicked off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And basically each step it just gets worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and worse and worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I might be talking out my ass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> This is how I remember it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck is wrong with us? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Wanting to watch people do
fuckin' stupid shit like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's entertaining. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually I had another flashback </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to another Derren Brown special. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He did another special
as well which is great </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where the audience get to choose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether something bad happened to the guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something good happened to the guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they would follow a
guy in his daily life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> He obviously signed a bunch of things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Literally the audience every
single time chose bad things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, one of them was, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> his family gets Christmas presents early </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or he gets fucking kidnapped. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And he literally got kidnapped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the audience wanted
to see him get kidnapped. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're fucked up! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We are fucked up! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know what the
most fucked up thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about that special was? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So the special basically ends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the audience shows
a bad thing happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like he got kidnapped or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I think as they
were trying to kidnap him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he got into a car crash. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now the car crash, the
car crash was staged. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The audience didn't know this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The car crash was staged. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so the audience see
him get hit by a car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, they just like,
this unplanned thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Derren Brown just walks off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you're just left seeing, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the audience kind of like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, what's going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like one of the
audience members going like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Excuse me, you're not being funny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "but like this like-" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "It's not our fault, is it?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't remember exactly what she says, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but she's like, "Excuse
me, this isn't funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Like, can you tell us what's going on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Like, why would you make
him go through this?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's, like, the lack of
self-awareness and self irony </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you literally came on a TV show- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And kept voting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And kept voting for
bad things to happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then something bad thing
happened that wasn't scripted, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but because it wasn't scripted, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> suddenly it's a serious matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was like really interesting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it was basically just like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> as the audience does not
care about who is on screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You just want to see bad things happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, these are people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you know it's staged. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause that's what you think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You think it's all fake or
like, or you don't care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a message about, like, anonymity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> within, like, crowds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's the word I'm looking for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hive mind? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like the hive mindset </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where if you have anonymity, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> responsibility is kind
of like taken off you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're willing to do, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're willing to do things
that you might not do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if, you know, you were
the one responsible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure I saw, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least four, like,
"Black Mirror" episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that were like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but "Black Mirror" sucks now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it sucks now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sucks so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It went downhill real fast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Is there anything else you
guys want to bring up or? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, watch Derren Brown I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This has been a really a strange episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> We talked about so many things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We sped run through stuff today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like watch Derren Brown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's all you gotta take away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You guys sold me on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Out of every British, like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like to show Sydney
some British TV shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like British TV shows, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people only know like fucking "Doctor Who" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and maybe "Top Gear," you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> British TV shows, they
have some good TV shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think Derren Brown is one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of the best examples you can get from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just quality TV shows
coming out from England. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you guys have convinced me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> so that's what I'm gonna do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - How can you not hear
any of that and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, I'm not really interested." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause the thing about British
TV shows is that they like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he would make one special a year at most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, they'd obviously been
like dwelling on this idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like a long time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, like some ideas
are better than others, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's no idea that you hear about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you think, "That's
not interesting at all." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - His one special he teaches old people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to, like, rob an art gallery. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was one as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, that's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You should watch that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It wasn't his best but it was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was a good one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can do that or go
watch another episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of "Don't Tell the Bride." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what it's called!
- That's what it's called! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We figured it out! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We didn't know what it's called! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Show's over now! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's all come full circle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I figured it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Don't Tell the Bride"
that's what it's called. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was thinking like "3,000
Pound Marriage" or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> In UK it was 3,000, it was 3,000, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it was 10,000. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The episode's over now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> The "Trash Taste" episode's over now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, hey, look at all
these patrons though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're pretty cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Before we end the episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna find out how
much money it was now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> I blitzed through that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It says, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they were given 12,000 pounds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ooh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, a bit more than I thought. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That sounds about right.
- Big boy money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's actually a pretty decent- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I knew it was a division of three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a decent amount of money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a decent budget that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can get away with
quite a bit for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And this was like the TV episode then. </SPEAKER_03>
