<SPEAKER_05> comes out to about six weeks before we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> last recorded </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um it has been like since we started </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trash taste i didn't realize how much my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> schedule relied on me going to trash </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> taste and just seeing the boys because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like it was weird just not seeing seeing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the both of you like every week i was so </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> thank you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so yeah we went back to the uk that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fun yeah how was it that was good i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how long has it been like two years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right almost since you guys might have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> two years yeah it's been it's been about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two years so it's been two years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> basically since i've seen any of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mates there or my parents or my family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't emotional </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did you guys hug it out yeah it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> weird seeing my parents really because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just like i've only seen them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through zoom for like two years and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just kind of like right right oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah it was weird having </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conversations with people not through a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> discord call or the zoom call because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you realize i i've forgotten what it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like to just actually catch up with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone not through a computer like damn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look at those graphics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i can touch them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i felt like when i went back to wales i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> felt like the pope going around a small </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> town i was like hi guys i'm my parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yes give me a hug </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'll give you i'll take a picture with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you parents um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's uh it was nice i uh i also learned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> from my past mistakes of when i used to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go back home </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um i actually like try to schedule as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> many hangouts with friends as possible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right i reached out to as many people as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> possible yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the last time i went home i just kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thought yeah i'll figure it out when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get there and i ended up like not doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> anything like half the days and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] i really should have yeah i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh i did the same thing as you and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i i think i i made another mistake and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think i planned two months oh yeah then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because because then then i i kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> realized about like five six days in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like not even like halfway through my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> trip </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing someone every day you haven't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> caught up to someone for two years what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> do they want to do like crack open some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> beers or a bottle of wine you just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you end up just eating and drinking like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] every single day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and so you basically downloaded the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> alcoholic dlc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically so i was there for 20 days and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one day i didn't drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jesus every single day i had at least </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> one beer or something just because that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> was like the thing yeah so i think that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you do in the uk yeah i think seventy to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eighty percent of my schedule for my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> days there were seeing someone or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> catching up with someone yeah so and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that that meant seventy to eighty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> percent of my trip was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> having some sort of drink yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> do you drink with your parents yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah so your parents are drinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as well right yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> my parents don't drink but since we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> haven't drank anyway no no but since we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> haven't drunk in two years they they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> they brought open a bottle of wine and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they had a glass i was just like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> okay oh it's this is a special occasion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like i think i've seen my mom drunk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before this once in my life and it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like my cousin's wedding yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just just the weirdest [ __ ] thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right because my mom's like my mom is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as far as my perception is like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> biggest straight edge there is right she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't drink she you know doesn't smoke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't do anything like that i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> never ever seen her like in my life i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think i've seen her like take a sip of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> alcohol about like i think five times in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> my life total total um and then i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> remember going to my cousin's wedding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh my entire family were there um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone had like flown in from thailand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so it was a rare occurrence that we have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a massive family gathered in one place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was the first time i'd seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a different side of my mum like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had no idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had no idea that there was just this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monster playing with it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it felt like it felt like almost </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like she she got more drunk than sydney </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the day she got drunk faster than </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sydney and that that gives you an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> indication of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how surprised i was right and i remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like halfway through the wedding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um i i come sit i i i come sit down and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my mom and dad are just sitting on this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> table </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my mom has a glass of wine in front of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i i don't know how much she had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drunk at this point and she was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gig oh my name's gig it's like gig do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you want you want to see me down this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> glass of wine i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no no no mom i don't want to see you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> mom no she was like i'll do it i'll do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it i was like mom no no no don't do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and she just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like mom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what are you 15 what did what are you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 18. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> meanwhile there's like six bottles of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> wine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the dance floor like this this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 10 11 p.m she was on the dance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> floor just like you know she was she was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh sydney was like pretty not sober but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> she was like merry you know she wasn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> completely drunk and then my mom just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> comes up to her takes takes the bottle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of um beer that she's drinking just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> downs in front of her and takes that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> gives it back to her i've never seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sydney so dumbfounded in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's awesome but yeah so so yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i ended up drinking with my parents a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit more which was a very rare </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> occurrence so of course of course i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna share some alcohol with them but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about like the fifth day in your body's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like please please no more like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> please i just like i i i like the social </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> aspect but my god my body just died like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> halfway through the trip i think jesus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> damn yeah i don't know i i just i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a thing where especially in with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my family they drink quite often </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so i feel like they saw it as an excuse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to drink more than usual yeah so then it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> become a thing where i was like this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> great but i'm dying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my dad's retired as well now so yeah now </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> many friends as possible and drink way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> too much alcohol we do that's kind of i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean like because uh we posted a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pictures while we were on like break in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the uk but i remember like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember we were catching up with a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> bunch of our friends and i actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hardly ever talked to connor yeah in our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trip i mean we did we we obviously like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talked and caught up and everything but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we mostly spent time with like just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> catching up with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> other people need to talk to you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah we see each other everywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we [ __ ] talk to you way too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like we had a mutual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> understanding that couldn't escape you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of like we've talked every week for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the past [ __ ] over a year now yeah we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can have a little bit time apart and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> think i think the only times that we did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do something together was uh i think we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> played like a game of chess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i was drunk we were both drunk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh and of course you beat me um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're the only time when there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately there was no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the next chess tournament should should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have our blood alcohol level measured </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before and you need to be x amount </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> required to play that's what we need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> disqualify if it's below 0.7 but you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a little too sober for my liking let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like you're not in you're right so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> brains every time you lose a piece you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got to do a shot or something i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know just just die yeah this this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what chess needs the next evolution </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from going from casual chess to just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolute abhorrence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i also like playing chess again i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember playing chess against you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because we had we had a physical board </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> none of this you know none of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> online chess business we're an old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> school and uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we even had like a chess clock and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything like that and uh i think i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> realized how much i've relied on like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the chess.com ui to really like oh it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very be good at the game because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> otherwise you have to look down like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this right because because i i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty interested at that point but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> remember i fell for like the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obvious checkmate of all time oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh and like and i i was like i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to question how i couldn't see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that because we bet 20 pounds on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know why we bet 20 pounds in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game i think i was like drunk at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> time but uh whenever whenever i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> playing games with friends i'm like 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bucks let's make it interesting let's do </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_05> people okay when they bump into you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right in japan right yeah and i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> totally forgot this is a thing this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the longest cable on earth man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when when people bump into you in japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they say sorry yeah so many people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bumped into me and were just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and didn't say something didn't say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything i i i could not every time that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> happened to me i could not stop saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> samimasen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just like it was just like muscle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> memory even if i hadn't bumped into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone i was like on the tube right and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like i was like i'm not in japan </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> or like subconsciously uh i had um one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing that happens in japan now i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> expect this so i i just i just noticed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that it was different when you get a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taxi in japan the taxi driver will </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> always try and help you with your bags </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even if you don't need it right yeah it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could be the smallest bag on earth and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he might try and come out and help you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with it yeah um and like never happened </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with taxis in the uk i know i was every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> time i had a suitcase or anything they'd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just sit in the car and then i'd have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> open the boot too as well which is fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> totally fine with that but i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought i was like oh yeah yeah there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the thing that we don't do right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um and that was most of them yeah that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was that was the most i'll tell you the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> biggest the the immediate thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that uh i noticed about going back to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the uk that i immediately missed about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> japan uh so i think it was the second </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> day that uh that we landed there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and um oh sorry my second day in the uk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we uh went out to just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> walk around brighton again walk around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> town uh because it's been a quite a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while since i've been in my hometown so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me and cindy just went out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did a quick shopping trip and uh i got i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got thirsty my throat was a little bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> parched right okay and so i started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> searching for a drink in order to quench </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> my thirst right and i look around and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where are the vending machines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how how am i supposed to procure some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> liquids so that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that's how they quench my thirst </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right and i walk around in this shopping </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> center and i'm like wait and then i soon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realized i have to go to a shop yeah in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> order to purchase some liquid it's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> even a convenience store like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> supermarket yeah they're like like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> corner shop yeah yeah yeah i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well what backward system is this you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know yeah i i need to go to go into a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> shop that sells other things other than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drinks and uh i need to do human </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interaction in order to purchase this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what is this we really do take for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> granted how many [ __ ] vending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> machines are on this car i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realize that because like sometimes i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just walking around i get a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thirsty and i'm just like literally a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minute away from the next vending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> machine i didn't realize how convenient </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was until i went to the uk and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's in a big shopping center </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of this is just like clothes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or like different different kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stores that are not like food drink </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> items and even if there is most of them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like you know something like super </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> drug or some some very big you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pharmacy store where they sell they sell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> drinks there but it's a it's way bigger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> than it needs to be so i end up like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having to go in go into this massive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> store go to like the small segments just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for food and drink and then and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> line up yeah and i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> disgusting disgusting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> not on my watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but that is like the first thing i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> noticed where it was just like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> really missed vending machines and just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like being able to like buy you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very conveniently buy a like a snack i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> felt that way as well when like whenever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i go back to australia or the or like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the us or anything as well because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we have vending machines like in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> australia in the u.s yeah but you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> have like a suica yeah right yeah so you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> have to like [ __ ] reach in grab your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] change jiggle that around and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know why they got your fired </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] vending machines in the west </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because sometimes the drink doesn't even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's true so i'm like oh good i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about to gamble three dollars to see if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i can even sometimes you get a double </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pool as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that just happens sometimes you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really lucky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you you buy a drink and you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm gonna buy another drink immediately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then but then the machine is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> designed in such a way that it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't handle two drinks being dispensed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at once so you have to like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scrunch your hand inside and like pull </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one out yeah just so you can unblock </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this [ __ ] thing yeah but i noticed as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> well obviously like i i got out of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> airport and just like no one was wearing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> masks really yeah yeah no one was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> wearing that and that not that i you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> know i don't i don't have a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> opinion on it i do whatever i'm told to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do right i'm a sheep all right what can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's taking a stance in the self-care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess i don't give a [ __ ] i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like if everyone around me is wearing a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mask i'll wear a mask you know what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean but it was one of those things i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whoa this is [ __ ] weird and like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause in japan it's like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll be crucified if you don't wear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> them you could be in the middle of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rice field and they'll still still find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a way to crossfire exactly and like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> was just like so strange just seeing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything kind of back to normal it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the uk just took the route of we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't give a [ __ ] anymore open back up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but was also it was but the rules are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different as well between england and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wales and because i was traveling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on welsh trains you have to wear a mask </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on english trains you don't have to wear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a mask but some trains go from wales to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> england so what happens is is that when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get into england people just took </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off their masks on the terrain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which does nothing which then just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> eliminates the whole point of you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah where i was like you know i'm not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think one or one of either is wrong all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right i'm just like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> invalidates for both if you have to put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it on or off yeah yeah you're on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same goddamn train it was yeah it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that was that's that's like you being on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a flight and then like oh we're we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [Applause] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and i was wearing a mask </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i thought this was only in like in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> america but someone came up to me and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like take off your mask </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what yeah someone came up to me like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take off your mask and i was like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't think i will and then he was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> why he was where were you i was in wales </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all right he was saying so yeah well you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to wear master i stolen well no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no you don't oh you just did anyway but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> no right um i was like the only person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wearing a mask right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i because i also i look like [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wanted to cover my face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i felt dreadful but he came up to me and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> he was like take off your mask and i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like no and then he was like why why are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wearing a mask and i was like i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ignored him i was just like i carried on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my phone and i was just like on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> train uh no no outside the train station </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right you just like take off your mask </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why i don't know some people get weirdly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> offended by it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like sorry i'm protecting myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you know like one time i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wearing it as well and the guy asked me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> uh he was like are you wearing that for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me or for you and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean both technically because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thing was is that even though you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we had a flight to get on so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was coming up to that flight i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm wearing a mask because yeah i do not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to get it yeah of course just be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> having to rearrange all my plans and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> delay transition yeah of course so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why i was wearing it and then i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was like oh my god i was like why are so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many people [ __ ] coming up to me and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> telling me to take off my mess because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're taking a stance and like i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i think going back to england because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had very similar experiences </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where um every time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time i'd meet like some group of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh some group of friends they'd question </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> me of like why i chose to wear a mask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> why i chose to put on this mask </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> autobiography </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they didn't listen to me until i put on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the mask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and so like i get questioned about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm just like i don't know i just i need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to fly back to japan in like two weeks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm pretty used to it and i just don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to take any risks i don't know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this that's just my my uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> my opinion man like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like why do you have to be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> accused for protecting yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not saying that's like being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why are you wearing the condom yeah take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like i'm going around being like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put your mask on put your mouth i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> give a [ __ ] you don't need to if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't if the government tells you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't need to wear it i don't give a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] don't wear it i'm just going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wear it but the government also says </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't wear a mask yeah like it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like they they're you know they're gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] you know take your mask away i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just feel i just feel like what i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> realized going back home at least in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> england it was it became very like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> political yeah like like it's it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as you know as as everything does but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like we got sheltered from that in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan because everyone here wears the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> masks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone here wore a mask before kovid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's why it was like super easy to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just integrate that into society whereas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um like people just don't like being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> told what to do in england </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> america as well you know it's it's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was it was something where just doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this one thing like wearing a mask was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the in in that environment you were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> making a statement or a stance or a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> choice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was conscious i guess and i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never really it's like what about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that deeply i get that but it's like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know why that is you know subject </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to ridicule or criticism right it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not like you're doing something bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> by protecting yourself yeah i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i i it was it was weird i didn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the other way around right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the way i looked at it was not even a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> political sense i was just like i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> want to wear it because i want to wear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it [ __ ] off yeah yeah like like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wearing a hat would you tell me i can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wear a hat like yeah yeah you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] what are you hiding yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like like me before going to england i'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never really thought about it that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> deeply i i think i've thought about you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know the difference between chicken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> breasts and chicken thighs more deeply </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than wearing a mask you know that's you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> should have just turned around the guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like it ain't that deep bro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just wearing a mask off my back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one one positive thing that i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changed about england though since i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been back is uh ever since ever since </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the pandemic uh a lot of a lot of big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> establishments now have made it possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for you to just order your food via qr </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> codes oh yeah that was yeah yeah i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like right we're getting to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the japanese way of things now yeah less </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> human interaction oh brilliant although </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i love it i was at nando's as you go i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> had i had to pause that just for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> dramatic yeah yeah i was in now nose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and i was i was trying to order my meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i was in a kind of a rush as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so i didn't have much time and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought oh it'll be easier on the app </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> turns out like the the this uh specific </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nando's restaurant just didn't have good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cell phone service </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they didn't have free wi-fi so i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like fighting for my life trying to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> order this [ __ ] thing and every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> single time i got to one webpage it just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could not get to the next one and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would it was like i had to keep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> resetting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i spent about 20 minutes trying to order </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this meal that i only had 10 minutes to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eat yeah and then eventually went up to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the counter and i was like give me this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they got my [ __ ] order wrong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was terrible i mean it was it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't taste good either really the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> specific nando's did not taste good and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> butterfly chicken burger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you mean the chicken breast burger yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah chicken breast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i had great nando's when i was done i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] missed the chips were kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] the coleslaw was not as good as i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> remembered i don't know it was uh i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know if my tastes have changed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe nando's isn't just as good as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> europe maybe that nando specifically i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> need to try more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i had kfc and that was fantastic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i had uk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the second biggest thing i noticed which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was i've really really missed japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> food service you know it's yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many times i'd go to restaurants and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like half the tables still had the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> from the previous customers on it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that just like isn't a thing in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> japan like that shit's gone immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah oh yeah they won't even let you in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the restaurant i mean sometimes they'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take the plate away while you're still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at the table yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because like i i think you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be after after being there for like two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weeks or something you you've had like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the food that you missed from being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in japan and after that you go back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your usual eating routine and you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like man like you forget how good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese food is and just like japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurants in general because like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> order anything here even if it's off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> ubereats or you go to a random </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> restaurant and it is it is just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really good food standards and i just i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just forgotten how many british </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> establishments were just really really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] mediocre right and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like after you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after like the novelty wears out of yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm having all these things that i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> missed being out of being out of the uk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after that wears off you're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> damn japanese food is just better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it is just so so much better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh yeah i've really felt that in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> last week in the uk where i just like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just missed having good food on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> daily i don't know do you have any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese food around no no i didn't have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> any japanese some food some of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> friends wanted to and i looked at them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're not having japanese food it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the first time i ever went to la </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they took me to little token i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i came from big token </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> episode of the simpsons when they go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> japan they go to america yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no no come on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah cause like what i didn't understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because i just realized this is you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the uk is also island nation like japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but japanese japan has really spoiled me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with good seafood and just you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> fresh seafood that you can find yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right everywhere basically and just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> getting good seafood in the uk so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] difficult and i don't know why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it is because we're an island nation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is smaller than japan you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know our coastline should be easier </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to get to why why is it so hard to find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> against the traffic yeah yeah yeah why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is it so hard to find good seafood oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that is not just like fish and chips you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah yeah i did have a good lobster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually did you yeah that was good but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how much did you pay for it you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the thing right like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> probably like if you want good food you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> probably have to pay arduous amounts of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> money you you do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like a seafood pasta yeah and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was really craving lobster because i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i didn't really get lobster in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan and i really wanted like a creamy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> did we get lobster in the uk uh yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if you can pay for it it's quite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> expensive okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not frozen canned stuff yeah and it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> really good and it was it was probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the most i depend on a single dish in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the uk and i i was it was something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> ridiculous like 30 40 or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but man was the lobster good that was so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> worth it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah every once in a while having like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like that like treating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yourself to something kind of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expensive is very nice but yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely something i felt so guilty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for when i was looked at the bill i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like i literally had a pastor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like filing a mortgage i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i do something similar in hawaii i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had i had a fifty five dollar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> possibility it was like once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> again it was another seafood pasta i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know what is about seafood pasta </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like there was so it was like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> entire cast of the little mermaid on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this [ __ ] parcel like there was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much seafood on it yeah and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> okay i now i can see why also 55 i'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never do that again yeah i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how australia is but i noticed that the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fancy restaurants in japan are cheaper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than the fancy restaurants in the uk oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because in japan right you can go to a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurant and you can you can buy a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bottle of wine and it's yeah even though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's obviously more expensive that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> would be buying it wholesale it's still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not that big bad like you can if we went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out together we could split a bottle of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wine and it comes to like 20 bucks each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe i i noticed wine in the uk was way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cheaper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someplace i went to like the the lowest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> price bottle was like 150 and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i want wine what kind of bougie-ass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> place are you going to not even not even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like not even like that bougie places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like these were like but the wine was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bougie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i don't know i don't know maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i should [ __ ] me for trying to eat good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no because i remember like i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> going to like tesco's and co-op to buy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like some wine and i recognized some of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the wine that was available over there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> premium wines here in japan that is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 20 bucks plus they get for like a five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or seven quid and like tesco's and i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just but i think that's just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan isn't really a wine drink that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's exactly it and for the most part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> when i noticed wines that were available </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can get wines for like a much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cheaper price because if you're drinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> wine in japan you you eating good you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know you drink you drink you drink it as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well this this is the hard part i wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to have the good the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the wine that was way cheaper and nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i also wanted to drink all the beer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i had to like it was very hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> haven't you again you can't do both you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't mix and match otherwise you end up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in uh you're gonna be in a coma the next </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i had a drink the next day so i make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sure that i was in peak condition at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> times that was the biggest thing that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i forgot about which was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> tactically choosing how much you drink </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you can survive and drink the next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> day as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you can get ipas and stuff like that in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan but like i i love like the craft </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beer in the uk it's really nice i miss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having good ciders </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i just missed that so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drank a lot i had tesco meal deal as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how was it was it good it was amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like all of this for three pounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> get out of here he says after having his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lobster pasta yeah it goes straight to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> testosterone you know i bought that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lobster pasta for like 30 to 40 dollars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know how much it was and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still didn't make me as happy as that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> three pound meal deal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was better it was honestly a part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of it tasted better i was like oh my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i get an innocent smoothie it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three pound smoothie in this three pound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meal deal they're practically giving it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> away i was i was happy going back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nando's that was like the biggest i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> home now i i am now home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i had subway as well that was nice oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> subway i forgot i've forgotten how good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> subway was outside of japan because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> subway in japan if you guys don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't toast the sandwich </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't custom you can't pick your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> bread no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean there's like there's like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two choices of bread i think what the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] is the point if you can't pick your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> bread and choose to toast it like i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i was so shocked when you couldn't toast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> your sandwich in japan yeah you what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like the best part of any i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even like subway that much that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally the drawing point off song </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because i don't even like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we can like uber each subway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here and sometimes when these two don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to choose they order a subway and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just like no if i'm not having my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> subway toasted it is not a subway yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> had a lot of fast food a lot of fast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> food yeah and i i'm surprised i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> obese by the time i came back with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> amount i drank and ate every time i saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you in the holiday i think you had a bag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of crisps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i went to town on christmas i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you were like more crisp than man i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like one day where like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> were hanging out and there was just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no food in this this like airbnb </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but there was like family packs of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> crisps sorry like 20 packs of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think your dinner that day was like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hot dog and like five packs of doritos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't five yeah it was like eight it </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> the americans yeah the chips the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> americans watching but yeah no it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> fun i i had a great time i got to see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the friends i wanted to see and yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's good yeah a lot of things really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worked out nicely because i was asking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people like last minute to hang out and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> luckily everyone was able to yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think like i had enough rest days in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there well towards the end because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> michael my body was just like i i i need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like not touch alcohol for like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> month after this and which is great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we've had quarantine since then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh yeah tell us about the the hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> experience so that's what i want to know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this this experience doesn't start from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the hotel it starts from the point where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we get off the plane it starts before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that it start before we've left the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] country it's already oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> me and connor had two very different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experiences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh leaving the country and getting back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the country yeah so i mean how should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we do this how do we split this up so we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just i have to go by section by section </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so first of all the most annoying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get even on the plane you need a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> negative covert test form now okay i am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> making a video about my quarantine hotel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing so there'll be in-depth stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about that if you're interested by the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way but but i'll give you the i i want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to talk more about it because i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to bog down that video we're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> complaining for nine hours so we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna complain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so so this whole thing is like confusing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normally if you want a negative test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most test providers would give you a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> form say hey you're negative take this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then everyone will accept it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally problem is japan doesn't work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that japan trend just decided we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gotta do things a little bit different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're doing it our way yeah it turns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like how about it's literally our way or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the highway yeah right it's like how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about we just give you a form that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need to fill out the very specific way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that we want it filled out and this just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sends fear down anyone who knows japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you know they're not playing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> games yeah i have heard that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some some airlines will let you on with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the negative test and you don't need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that one but why would you risk it so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i was [ __ ] myself because i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how the [ __ ] do i fill out this form so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this form uh needs to be signed and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> stamped by a doctor it can't be it can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> be a nurse it has to be a doctor the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> test can be administered by a nurse but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has to be signed and stamped by a doctor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so but most testing facilities don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have a doctor who's going to stamp or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sign it for you so then now you have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> find a place that has a doctor that will </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stamp it turns out like none of these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> test centers have doctors that are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> willing to sign or stamp things for you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah so manage to find </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i found after i basically i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i went to the uk government website and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got the email of every single test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> provider they recognized and sent out a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mess email to all of them this was a big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mistake because then what ended up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happening was it was one thread </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> replying to each other no no no no no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> no it was a blind carbon copy so they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> weren't each other but for me it was one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> thread so i i sent this email off and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> within about 10 minutes i realized the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mistake that i'd made because i had 15 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> replies in one thread and i couldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keep track you basically opened a forum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> post yeah i basically opened a forum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> post </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> directly to the person and so i got like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 50 responses in the first day of you'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be like this is okay but then some of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them were like yes this is totally fine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like say yes to everything so so they i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had to then call up places that said yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i walked them through it i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are you sure this is okay and and one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them was like yeah that's no problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we've done it all the time that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> totally we've had people go to japan all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the time from our facility and i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great okay so i booked on with them 150 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pounds right it's like 200 right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> damn all right so but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know japan i i i know that i should i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> should have a backup just in case </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't [ __ ] trust like that this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i should cause you have to get it 72 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> hours before so if i [ __ ] this up uh i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm panicking to try and find something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so i booked two yeah i booked another </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> test but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i this this place said book a test with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> us and then when you get your results </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three hours later take those results and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> book a doctor appointment and then get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the doctor to sign and stamp it all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> jesus so i did that too yeah so i had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that first so i went to this testing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> facility at 8 am i they shoved a thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up my nose i'm dying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then i get my results at 11am yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's negative and i'm like great </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> great so then i go to the doctor and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> perfect they they sign it all they stamp </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it all it was all super easy but i had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to pay individually for both those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> things so it's like 150 pounds for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> test again right or no 90 for that one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then 90 for the doctor's appointment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jesus so this is already like 400 500 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bucks yeah just on the test yeah um i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not not counting the amount you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pay for the test to get in the country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to pay for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you have to like a lot of things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people don't consider is like i spend a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot we both spend a lot on just tests oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes so many tests because because you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> got to obviously get tested before you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fly out of japan to the uk and then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to get 150 bucks which it was not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 150 bucks and then you have to pay for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another test when you land in the uk as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well which is also about 100 bucks yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lots of tests so many goddamn tests yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like if you're thinking traveling is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just you just have to consider the cost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the airline that's not a thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> anymore which are also there they've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> increased the prices on the flights that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they know people are flying so like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> direct flight from japan to london it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was very expensive compared to what it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> normally would be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um well you also looked very i did also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> book very like but even then it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still more expensive normally um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so yeah so i got this paper and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like great i have this this japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> document signed the way i think i sent a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> message to rayna scully who'd also done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> traveling abroad and i was like i sent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> her a picture of the signed document i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like does this look okay and she's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it looks great and i'm like okay good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i had the next appointment the next </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> day for the people who are like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dude it's all okay and i should get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'll get it signed there and all that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but to me it didn't make sense a little </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bit because they i was like how are you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna sign all this stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when i have to wait three hours for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> results yeah right so i turn up to this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this test the next day because i'd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> already paid for it so i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] i mean i'll get another test why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not let me know um i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i go there and i'm like okay so you need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to fill up this formula like no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what do you mean like no we don't fill </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out that form i'm like would you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i called you up and you said that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could fill out this form and they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like no no no we don't do that we will </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> give you a form i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but you that's that's not that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not good enough for japan i told you i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> told you this yeah on the phone call and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you said it was no problem and they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like no we're not doing that did you not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> read the forum yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the thread and so then a woman a woman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> came out of the office and she was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh no no no come on you're going to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to japan she's like oh yeah come with me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so i go there and i'm like all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so can you fill this out no no i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna fill it out and i'm like wow why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> aren't you gonna fill it out she's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh because the form i'm gonna give you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is gonna be enough anyway it's gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have your passport information on it and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like all right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i already knowing that i had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the signed document put me at ease i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably would have been very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uncomfortable if i was in that situation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and didn't have a backup and i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> glad i didn't because i got my test </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> results after you know filling out this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> form and doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they they were like we promise it'll be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fine we promise this form will be enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah and so i'm like okay fine all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right fine so i get my results back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> later it's got even less information on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it and no stamp no doctor signature than </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the other test result i got to take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to the doctor which wasn't even the real </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one right so they've given me this piece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of [ __ ] form and then i went to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> website i should have done this before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like and the reviews were like terrible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for this clinic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i found out it was a clinic but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like a weird modern </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> medicine-esque clinic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but but it was a legitimate covert </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> testing they they were laughing right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not for official documents i'm guessing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so then i was like all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm gonna i'm gonna see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because now i have two forms yeah when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i go to the airport i'm like i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna give them the [ __ ] one first and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see if they accept it yeah and they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> probably thought i was [ __ ] weird for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doing this as well so i give them the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> form and then they look really confused </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they looked really uncomfortable and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they brought like some staff over and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> knew they were about to tell me like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't get on the flight with this yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i was like and before they said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything to me i was like by the way i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> have another form just in case and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> looked at me like what would you mean oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i have like another test with the form </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> filled out and they looked at me like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm like i was doing something really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bizarre i imagine it would be they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like why didn't you just give us it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like why did this guy do like a bait and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> switch because if i paid 150 bucks for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this i wanted to make sure that it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this man limit testing the system right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i wanted to see it's all right here's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the full patch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i wanted to see if i had been ripped off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i i realized now i played paper </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> please the other day and i feel like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is what they did in paper please </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some people just wouldn't give their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> passport or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> testing for bugs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they didn't tell me they weren't gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> accept it but yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> they were like bringing managers over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff after i had them this form and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't let's let's not worry let's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> kick me out here's the real one here's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the real yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because like i i talked to like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> few people who had traveled to the home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> country and back to japan before i even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> flew and that's how i knew about this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> quarantine hotel that we were going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> have to stay in yeah we'll get to that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but uh they every one of them told me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need to get this form this form that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the japanese government give you signed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't matter what any clinic says </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't matter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what they promise if you don't have this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> form you're not gonna get you're not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna guaranteed to get back in right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and so you have to look for a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> specific clinic that can fill out this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exact form with a doctor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is a lot harder to find than you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> originally think it is right it's really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> difficult yeah it's there's there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> big difference between getting a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> positive covert test which is all you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> need to get out of japan but getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> back into japan you need to have this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exact form in order to get back in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and luckily connor kind of went a few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> days before me so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i i had like my own clinic booked and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hearing about his second experience i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like yeah i'm just gonna go for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> proven way and uh yeah let connor be my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh beta tester yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just like it was so stressful i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was just trying to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just trying to get a goddamn piece of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> paper signed yeah and it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> impossible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know luckily i managed to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know how it would be in the us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um i just know that getting doctor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> appointments in the uk is quite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> difficult unless you're spending money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a lot of money um so and again it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of come under a lot of criticism </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> rightfully so because traveling even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> though it you know obviously it's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> luxury in general but like they've made </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it ridiculously expensive to travel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah like we i've already spent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like 600 500 bucks on covert tests alone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah same thing which i you know i'm i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> lucky enough to afford that but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's pretty [ __ ] that it's that much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah you know i mean like and it's yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's weird it's it's annoying so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then yeah i got on the plane and then i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> almost felt too easy because i got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through checking and it was super easy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like was it easy for you as well yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was very easy show them the paper they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> were like yeah have have fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah once once you get once you show the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> paper which was the same for me like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going out the country once you show the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> paper and everything's accepted then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like it's it's the most stressless </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> experience i've had in an airport </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's [ __ ] empty because no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one's traveling so you're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [Applause] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> security or anything you just walk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> straight in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and it's just it's just a breeze i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> never had like after everything got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> accepted i've never had a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more pleasant experience in an airport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i never i never thought you could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have a good experience in an airport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until until like until now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was really chill yeah i had a great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> time at the airport it was i charge all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my devices i was like there was in my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> terminal i think i counted there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like 20 people in the whole waiting area </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wow it's like the the whole thing yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so you had like you know your whole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> section to yourself it was really nice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty good yeah but then uh but then it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> came to coming back into japan and we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> always obviously talked about the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> documents </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was just the start of the process </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right because you get off the plane and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously you have to present the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> documents and everything like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and they put you they put you into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this like this queue of just checkpoints </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's like eight checkpoints </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's before immigration </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] out so yeah eight checkpoints </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> before you can even get to what is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> normally the annoying part yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you kind of like you you go in and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> give you they present you these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> documents right and then they give you a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] tag right that you have to put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over your hand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to identify you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's exactly it so you're literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like being cattle being herded through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's how it's how they know you're going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the quarantine hotel they put this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> large </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> thing on your hands yeah like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they literally they literally tag you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and i took it off for a second and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> someone shouted at me because i wanted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to get my coat off and i took it off and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like like two men came over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like shouting and like panicking at me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and pointing at us put it back on and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like what the [ __ ] man like give me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a [ __ ] second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so like you have to they give you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> about like 17 million documents that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they will just like check a call like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> across like this journey that you take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because and and the thing is like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> present this document they check it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> great go to the next checkpoint they ask </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the same document </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and they check it you go to the next </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point and for some reason like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these few documents that you you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get checked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a total about like five times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like by by different checkpoints even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though nothing changed between you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walking from point a to point b right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like eight stops right so the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first stop is they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so this is also a thing right no one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> told me this you have to keep your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> boarding card </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally on airplanes i just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] the moment i'm on the plane i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just like put the boarding card in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> pocket scrambled up or something yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's really because you don't need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it anymore you're on the plane you do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you the luggage the luggage tags what'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you do with the luggage tags because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's normally on your card oh no they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> normally put that on your passport or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something oh really oh yeah but the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> luggage tags i know i know my bag i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> never had to use it i i always hold on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to it until i'm out at the airport oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the luggage tags i keep but normally the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> boarding card i would like to scramble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my pocket or something oh really tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me no one told me you needed it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you never need it at an airport right i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just hold on to it just in case yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just in case you can't throw it away i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> not like on the plane [ __ ] tearing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> up but like yeah i don't think about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> much i kind of just yeah whatever but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you needed it so when you get off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the plane they ask for like your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> passport your boarding pass and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> documents now i printed off all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> documents that the japanese government </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> told me to have yep turns out that some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of them they just give you on the plane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anyway yep so i didn't need to print </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them out so i did i didn't even end up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> using my version i used the ones that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they printed out for me right uh because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like smaller and the one i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> printed out was a4 and it was like a we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i yeah i didn't understand so so you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have these two documents one of them is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a declaration saying that you're a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boy and you won't leave your house and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you won't break quarantine rules and if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you do they'll deport you okay um and if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not ominous at all yeah and if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you're a japanese national i think they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will do criminal charges or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i don't know how much they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> enforcing it um and another one was uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to circle the countries you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> came from you've been in the past 14 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> days yeah and then you sign your name </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff and then they always check </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this and they put like they put a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your information on the sheet i didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> realize which sheet was going to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> important yeah so i didn't i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> either so yeah the first check is they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> check those documents and the next one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the wellness wellness check where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they take your temperature and then you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> have to do a cover test immediately at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the airport okay so you use like a pcr </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> test not like an antigen test as well so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the difference between a pcr test is you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to like take your spit yeah whereas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with an antigen test i think you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> shove the thing in your nose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like it's like an instant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> almost an instant like response with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> antigen test with the pcr it takes like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> an hour you need a centrifuge for it so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the other way around the pcr test is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one up your nose i think the antigen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> no i i i think you can i'm i mean i took </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> bikes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all i know is that they put it in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> centrifuge that's yeah yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's how they tested it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that's why they can do it fast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you you get like asked oh you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feeling okay uh you know they check your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> temperature again i don't know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> happens if you have a high temperature i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> assume they just like put you down like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just like shoot you on the spot i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know like i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> grab the pillow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_05> and then you get get put into the bus </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> waiting area mm-hmm yeah and that was a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> long time i waited to be shipped off to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the butchers basically basically and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they've gotten it's weird because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they've got they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> laid you out like you're sitting on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bus yeah do they do that for you as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they're in a corner and you're all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting like you are on a bus it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a dress rehearsal it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're on a bus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like what they do in school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's exactly where where like you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like this teacher who leads you onto the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bus and you have to sit in like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> exact same way you sat down and i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and and then you know once you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> got all that then okay so this whole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> process this part took like three hours </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and then you can go through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> immigration right which which takes a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> while again yeah but luckily because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's no uh no um people traveling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a little quicker yeah um but yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it does just take yourself yes so you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you if you fly back in japan at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> moment uh regardless of how quickly or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how many people are like flying in with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you you're going to be in the airport </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for around three to four hours i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there for five before you get to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immigration </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before you can even get your bags </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i was i was there wondering am i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even gonna get gonna get my bags today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like what's happening with that so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so you're basically after your 12 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hour journey which is what we had 12 13 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hours on a plane you have to draw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> another four hours in an airport being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> herded </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um through this through the system which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it kind of felt like this dystopian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> society yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you were just treated like cattle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a piece of meat being hurted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through herded through uh you you you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> know you were there to be processed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which is weird man because i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> what happens if you just don't follow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> along yeah it was just really weird and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> uh very strange you are you are treated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> almost like uh a disease rather than a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> person yeah yeah um which you know i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> don't give a [ __ ] about it's whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's just weird um waiting for my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bags to take so long because you have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because obviously when you get your bags </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the airport you can just go yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because we're all on the same bus i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all dirty travelers uh we have to all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wait till everybody's gone through and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everybody's got their bag and then you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can start going through the bag checking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so you still you kind of once </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you've got your bag you still gotta wait </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i don't know if this happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to you they bring out like search dogs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff yeah and they checked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like oh my bro i'm i don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the dog can smell covered can it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what what is this i'm like this is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> joke and they like they were like i </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> weird controversial and the owner is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> controversial figure of apple hotel i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think as well anyway stay in a just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fun little history um so this hotel i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had one of the rooms and it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's a business hotel so you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> supposed to like be in there all day the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> idea is that you go you travel to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somewhere in japan you do your business </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the the day and then you sleep at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> night it's just used to sharing yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because i've got everything i've stayed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the app hotel as well um probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they're all very similar styles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah extra i remember like there's only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enough space in there for a bed yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and like and like there's no room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to walk at all it is very much like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> prison cell yeah because you do have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tv right but the tv's right like you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> can probably kick the tv with how close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it is to the bed because it's it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it has like enough space to contain a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> human being in it right and that's what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's designed yeah so i'm 5 10 and my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> feet were just at the end of the bed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so if you're like six five yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah bro you're [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i show it off in the video a lot that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i filmed but the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get this room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's about um two steps </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> horizontally and like two steps vertical </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of walking room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so that's all the room you have you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not allowed to leave the room obviously </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah um and if you do try and leave the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> room there is an armed guard outside who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> will shout at you if you even open your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> door for long longer than like five </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seconds uh because i spoke to an irish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guy who was there and he said he wanted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get some fresh air in his room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you can't open the window you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't even crack it open all right like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the window doesn't open at all yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you want any fresh air like you you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't yeah so it's kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at least by the second day my room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> started to smell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so i understand that he wanted to leave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> his door open apparently like two guards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> came over and like told them to close </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the door and if you do it again they'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like do something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we never saw him again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but all right and now so you spent three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> days there right if you get a negative </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> test you get to leave yeah all right the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scary thing was is the moment i landed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i got into my hotel i got an email </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the ministry of health telling me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that somebody on my flight tested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> positive for kovid oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so if i got kovit i would have to stay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in that hotel for 14 days [ __ ] so that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know when they change your sheets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or do anything like that so they don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> change your shoes right right but like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> was like accumulating a lot of trash i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean like meals and stuff adds up and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the bottles and stuff adds up can you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get rid of that no i only the meal they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they didn't collect bottles or they they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> took yours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll get into that we'll get into that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay the room itself is nice like it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good hotel except the pillow the pillow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my [ __ ] god this this pillow this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pillow is meant as for sadists it's one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of those concaved like medical pillows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so your neck is like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> right because it's supposed to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stretch your neck out yeah that is not a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i do not want to sleep on that when i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have jet lag and i'm trying to just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fight for my life to get eight hours of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sleep here and so i told gone i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bring her to paint your own pillow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because these pillows suck but you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't have a hotel so yeah you didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> need it but yeah definitely the worst </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> thing was not being able to walk or have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fresh air yeah and i thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> okay at least even even in prison they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> get one hour of outside time a day right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah can i come out can i have one hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of outside time please i want some some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> walking but it's only three days so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not matter yeah it's it was [ __ ] but it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had to be done right and then the meals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were crap right yeah so you guys sent me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pictures of them oh yeah i got i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> posted one of them and i was like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the saddest breakfast ever and it </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> armed guards just like a bunch of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the people who worked at the hotel who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were obviously like dexter there was no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> security there was security but they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weren't armed they were just people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it looked like they were just people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worked in the hotel just like with a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> full like hazmat suit on basically oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's totally different okay so so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um so here's a hack if uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's a life hack that i i learned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> going through this process is if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're traveling with someone they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> will give you extra privileges and extra </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rooms yeah because because connor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> traveled by himself i did and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> traveling with sydney so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh when they sat us down and uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gave us gave us the whole spiel of love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh you can't do this you can't drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> alcohol you go you can't leave your room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't open your window yada yada um and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then i was just like oh i mean me and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sydney are together can we get a bigger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> room please because my god like your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> room contained a double bed but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't know it was a semi double a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> semi dump semi double </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is no way i could stay with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another person in that room so me and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sydney were deciding should we just you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know say we're separate in case we can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know in case they do put us in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same room um but i'm just like let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's see what they say we say we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> together and so i said oh i'm with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> sydney can we uh stay together please </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were like okay we'll we'll see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what we can do and uh so they go off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they go off they talk to like their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> supervisor or something they come back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they tell us oh yeah i think we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can get you a uh we can we we can get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> your room uh suited for two people and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that at this point the suite is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> open at this point i didn't know what it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meant right so i i'm like doubling down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like um is this room big enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for two people because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh like if it is not big enough for two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people to stay in for possibly two weeks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if we test positive for covid you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god forbid but if it is not big enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then we would rather have separate rooms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and then they go off they go off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chat chatting again uh to the supervisor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they come back and they'll go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they get they they go </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> we had we had a receptionist right so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we walk into the room we notice uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we noticed we noticed that there's only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> one pillow and we're like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what do we do well there's only one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pillow we can't contact anyone so i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like there there's this they gave </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> us like a hotline in case anyone um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in case anyone like developed symptoms </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or anything like that yeah um that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can phone </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> you can phone this this this hotline for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any other requests that you may need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> during your stay as well and so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we called them up and uh they were just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how was your condition and i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything's fine um there's only one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pillow in my room unfortunately and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's two people staying here can we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get another pillow and they were just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah yeah sure don't worry about it </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> we'll have someone deliver a pillow to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you like like normal hotel service and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then so we get another pillow we start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> checking in we start looking at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> instructions and then we can see uh we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see that we can order things to our room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like we can order amazon and we're going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to order deliveries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as well they said i could do that but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they had like a very uh weird list of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff you weren't allowed to order like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> burgers and pizza and chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like food certain foods but it wasn't it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was really oddly written that i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really understand it and you couldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get certain things like amazon delivered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they said that you couldn't yeah we so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we we actually were able to get amazon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> deliveries to our room we couldn't get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> overseas we couldn't get hot food that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like that was like the only thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we couldn't get which was hot foods </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so we can get amazon deliveries we can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get anything that would help our stay be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more pleasant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um we had like a laundry service where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would come collect laundry at 7am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they would like deliver it deliver </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it back to our room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we had like a garbage service that would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they would pick up garbage every morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i had my garbage in my room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we also had a masseuse just like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they they would like give us new </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> garbage bags every day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so we could fill it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and honestly our food aside from like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> being cold was pretty damn [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we got like a kind of we got your food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it looked way better than mine yeah we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got like a [ __ ] decent bento every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> day i mean this is some this is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some of this [ __ ] was better than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> matsuya you know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like how what what was like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> water situation in your place did they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> go yeah so so you can ask for more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> bottles of water you only got one bottle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of water okay with every meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i ran out because i was a thirsty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> boy yeah i asked for more and they said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> oh sure we'll deliver it they never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> delivered it yeah it just didn't turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out so so so when we went in oh uh so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i want to say our place also had a mini </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fridge as well oh mine did as well did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yours as well okay i think most hotels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just like it just never got cold though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like it's just a container yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it made it like less than room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> temperature which i was like i guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's good but like i mean what am i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to do come and make them replace </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] fridge yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like we realized water would be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a very important resource to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> survive as as it is they said you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> use tap water but you know obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of you know just like [ __ ] in japan so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so we go in and there are there is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> two bottles of water which is standard i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> guess for every hotel stage i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> even have that you didn't no okay so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they gave us they started off with two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bottles of water and then we opened the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> mini fridge and it was a mini fridge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> full of bottles of water [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mine wasn't even on i didn't turn it on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the start of our journey we had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eight bottles of water which was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brilliant and every time they delivered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> meals which was like three times a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah um which was like they gave us more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> food that then i needed because like by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the time i i had like the breakfast was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> massive and by the time lunch was being </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> things where when you see it and hear it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like doesn't sound too bad but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then when you do it you're like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is really [ __ ] depressing yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> meanwhile me and sydney were just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing games on like the big screen tv </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the living room and i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's [ __ ] [ __ ] brilliant i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> let's pull out the ps5 we packed it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't have a game console i tried </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> playing uh some games on my laptop but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediately was like oh this is just not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> comfortable yeah it's not comfortable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> doing this yeah i don't know and the the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> smell of my room was so goddamn bad it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was all the food yeah it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> coagulating in the air yeah and we'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sweat yeah but then like after reading a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> few more posts and after like talking to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> various people i think your health your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel quality experience is literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> down to chance well yeah because there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three buses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i noticed there's three bus lines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they all take you to a different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hotel and whichever one you go to uh you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> get a different experience yeah i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think our hotel was not just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> business hotel it was like it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually like a four-star hotel yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they put us in which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like it yeah which i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] i got your luck man the lords </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> are on your side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what i will say i know i i this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is kind of this i don't know i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make any more squid game jokes but this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was yeah when i got on the bus that we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all came on there was like half the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people on the bus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right which means that half of them got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coveted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] hell it was weird first round </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> elimination </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the irish guy was there who i spoke to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the old man was there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> so i saw that guy without his mask on in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> front of like seven armed guards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like damn man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what day did you travel on was it a date </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what would you mean like was it like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saturday like a friday and it was all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same it was all it was it was all it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was because what i will say is that i uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i traveled like right i traveled on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a weekday so like not many people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were traveling so i feel like i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> traveling on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friday maybe i don't know i mean yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> friday's like a peak time for people to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> travel i'm not sure you know i have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have a look but yeah it was um because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like if you travel on the weekend i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think more people travel on the weekend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the worst hotels are for the are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when there are too many people traveling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it kind of like bleeds out yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because yeah i think we'd like there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we didn't have too many buses right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> which is why like we i think we had like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one or two buses um and they all went to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the same place yeah so i i feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once that hotel started getting filled </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out i mean if you think about it why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> would you need to drive one and a half </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hours for like because we flew in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through hanada which is like south right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah there's no reason to drive to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel in the [ __ ] north well they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> drove to the hotel and they drove us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> back to the airport yeah and then when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get to the airport you have to have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> weird specific uh taxi you can't get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normal taxi yeah can't book a normal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taxi it has to be a quarantine approved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taxi yeah right um and the problem is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i didn't know what time we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> leaving no so how what time i should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tell this taxi i couldn't figure it out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so i didn't know so i i just i guess now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to wait for two hours at the canada and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the thing was right is that so this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whole period has just been in quantity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right they drop you off at canada </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're like [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no one checks you no one makes sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everyone just went went off and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like where's everyone going does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone know where they're going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i spoke to the irish guy who had um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who'd done it a few times and he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah you can just like chill around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the airport and wait i'm like well i can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just go to like the cafe and like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interact with people he's like yeah if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you want to and i'm like that doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seem right i didn't i just i stood in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like a corner waiting yeah away from </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> i'm sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but i mean yeah i got it was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> weird and it was literally like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dude who's been in jail life for most of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> their life trying to simulate back into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> society right i thought they were gonna </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> think no no they haven't okay oh they've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just they probably will see they reduced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the quarantine time before we flew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh i mean before we flew off to england </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was six days in quarantine hotel and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then they got halved two three days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> six days in that hotel which is like six </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> days [ __ ] [ __ ] why couldn't he why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> couldn't he be sick he would have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a shiver at that thought another day </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> like taking it out on me i was like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was getting so annoyed well i mean those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are humans those people couldn't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tweet to the japanese government right </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> they were like you're so lucky that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can re-enter japan like i'm lucky that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can re-enter the country i [ __ ] live </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> don't don't try and say that i'm lucky </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that is pretty unfair we're all we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> all unlucky that the government has some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shitty rules on this like don't don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> take it out on each other that's why i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> got annoyed about it because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people are attacking other people who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are able to get into the country instead </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of i don't know blaming the people who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are making the rules and these arbitrary </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rules between countries yeah like in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> america right some some states have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quarantine but others don't yeah and so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there's this whole weird thing where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like why i mean it's all one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> country right yeah but it's yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same in australia as well like most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the states the like i mean australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> had that the [ __ ] worst though like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> victoria i think was locked down for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 280 days in a row yeah something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that like no interstate thing like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my sister was like yeah i can't i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> allowed to travel more than 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kilometers from my house yeah otherwise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i get fined but like but like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing stopping you from just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if you live in like so one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> countries that was banned was like texas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could just fly from the state the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> state yeah the states the state was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wishes uh the state of texas was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> one country that you would have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quarantine in yeah um go to the hotel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for but there were other states you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't have to go to the hotel for how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> weird so like why wouldn't you just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> drive over to the next state and fly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> from there and just say that you've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there because there's no way they can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> validate that they can check that right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so to me it just felt really like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] weird that but like covert has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shown that the the rules are not to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> with what's practical it's political </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> ties and yeah all those things if we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> learned anything and that's what is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shitty is that it sometimes feels like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just caught up in some inter uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> international [ __ ] politics of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> countries that don't like each other and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> countries that do like each other yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty much favoring i mean the uk did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it a lot too with countries as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've been pretty bad for it um it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just a mess and i hated it and it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well at least you guys got to you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sit here with me yeah yeah i mean i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean like look at us you guys you guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made it you made it i mean like for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> longest time we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like literally trapped in this country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we couldn't fly out for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> longest time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just been it was only recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the rules got changed that people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are already residents can fly out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then fly back in yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i mean now we're just waiting for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the actual you know people who are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting on visas because i you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can only imagine that that that does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> suck you know because like like we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really lucky to be able to get our visas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before all this happened otherwise we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would have literally trash taste would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have never happened yeah right if we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would had applied for our visas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally a few months after we got our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> visas yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we uh we would still be waiting now to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like even get our visas to move to japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it's actually crazy to think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about and japan faced a lot of criticism </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when the chronovirus started because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they they banned um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> only japanese nationals were allowed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back in yeah right which is like okay i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess that makes sense but then they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also didn't allow uh green card holders </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> permanent residents um really yeah so if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're married if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> uh if you're like me you're british and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're married to a japanese woman and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you went and then you came back in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though the my like if i was married to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese person they'd be allowed in but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i wouldn't be allowed in oh [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i need a few people who that came under </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a [ __ ] ton of criticism rightfully so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because if you're because if someone's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> permanent resident of your country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's literally like where their whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life is you can't just say like no but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they did and they faced a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> criticism which they did eventually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> change but they've still been banning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> visas and like i feel really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry for these these students who had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their life on pause who wanted who had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their whole like basically two years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lined up in japan yeah they've just been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> banned from entering japan like they've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been just been waiting yeah and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't make sense to me that they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> wouldn't allow some system even if it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> complicated and even if it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stupid and tedious to get in if you're a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> student yeah like i don't understand why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that why they haven't changed the rule </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on that it's just japan being japan you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know yeah it's because japan thinks that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh the foreigners you're more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> likely to get it if you're a foreigner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is just not true yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just one of those things where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know you can go through enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> precautions and you can do enough tests </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make sure that like 99 of the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll get it so that it's it's good and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it works but i don't know to me it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just i can't fathom it while they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> banned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> issuing any visas at all it really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't make sense to me yeah i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know it's dumb as [ __ ] yeah and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> after going through that quarantine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> experience like i i don't believe any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone who's flying in is like spreading </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> co-fit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> people my god they have this [ __ ] on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lock down man yeah honestly um i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you need there's like two tests </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when you get here and your test before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously somehow someone did get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> covered on my flight but they were that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was caught and then if you test positive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in the three days you know you have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i understand it can still slip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> through yeah but also it feels like such </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> diminishing returns at this point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to keep this rule in place you know i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> mean it's whatever i'm sure everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will have a personal opinion about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and that stuff i understand allowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> tourists in obviously i get that this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh which is which is opening the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> floodgates but then there's people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are like literally waiting on a working </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> order </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it breaks my heart man i really feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> sorry for these people who had their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> life lined up to come here and they've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just been just hanging around waiting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really i do feel so sorry for them yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's so [ __ ] it's really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> well hopefully soon i mean the the cases </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are going down a lot nowadays yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i saw an article today that was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> japan's uh drop in covert cases baffles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also i heard that japan isn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> testing as much so i mean yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i mean it's also because like most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> young people now are finally [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> back yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have we missed anything since we've been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> gone um i mean the country's opened back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> up again i mean in terms of like the the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> lock down quite unquote i mean i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so like </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> do it for a week before you shut that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] down again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just like the floodgates were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> open everyone went out drinking and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a week later everyone's just like well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that was a good time experts are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's a bad idea let's not do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the japanese government managed to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that i think they've never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> done before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> test the patience of their population </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and piss them off yeah i've never seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people get so actually angry about [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah which doesn't happen yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people actually got so angry about them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> keep extending the lockdown yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're so [ __ ] wishy-washy as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like they're like oh yeah so uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the cases are going down it's not zero </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's going down so maybe we can open </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it up again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the and then it goes back up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> well surprised that's a baffle surprise </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> and it was insane yeah having it all in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one video yeah the sheer amount of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people that got fired off the olympic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> committee is insane it was like half of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> them yeah and then the amount of </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> was like this is [ __ ] so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> weird oh my god i mean so far it seems </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be going all right um i mean the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> other day i was at a at a park </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and with some of my friends and someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we should do a bold gamer move we should </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drink a beer in this park and i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it felt like it felt like someone just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> offered me cocaine i was like no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a good idea i think someone's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> watching this this doesn't feel right </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> their minds like yeah psych it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> locked down again well the real question </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is is karaoke open because that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is that everything that's how you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lockdown's actually ended once the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> karaoke opens that's like the equivalent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like when the british pubs are open </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> viewers concurrent yeah which was more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> than i normally have i was very </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> there was like 7 000 people watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this yeah i i i was like i saw that </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> weird waking up and seeing like people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> had subscribed like paid to sub to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> while i was sleeping yeah i'm like right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] i should just sleep on stream all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the time i get paid to sleep [ __ ] me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm kidding it's weird though so i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like why did someone give me 50 subs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> while i was sleeping it's like 300 quid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more than that i think actually it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of money i'm like what the [ __ ] the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most generous tooth fairy in the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what is this what's going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but it was weird and i'd have like weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> moments where i would wake up but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't remember waking up and i would see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> clips of me waking up and i was like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't remember that i don't remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that i saw a clip of you i don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were half asleep or not but you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like flipped off the camera </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh that was halfway through your sleep i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was trying to sleep right and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people just went ham with my lights all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right and they just started changing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every second and then i was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] you guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um yeah it was fun though i really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> enjoyed it i didn't think uh it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> something i ever thought i'd be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> interested in but i thought [ __ ] it i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try it and uh i obviously had a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fun i'd recommend you guys try it out no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm good i'm good man i like i like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> privacy i i can barely stream i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> barely stream as it is people want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people always tell me they're like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys should do a trash tasting or you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just take it and turn streaming and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i was like oh it could work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something sometimes i mean i i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if if we did it as a group it would be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> easier yeah like by myself [ __ ] [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do shifts like we're together sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but then [ __ ] i mean i've done like long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> streams with other people yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that go for like 15 to 20 hours i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't do it by myself i couldn't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it by myself yeah yeah i don't know i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i didn't have like many guests come on i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just had uh iron mouse play with me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which was great it's fun when you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> someone else to talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because that's the thing is like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have someone else to bounce off of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right then you don't have to be like so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he was likely talking to china the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reasons why i decided to do it um so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> had not been streaming for like a month </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before i left for the uk and so i didn't </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> pay you for editing fees but you get 50 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of whatever it makes and then uh we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought we'd be in the red for a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh or we thought he'd be in there for a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while but luckily yeah it took off and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now it's doing really really well and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's killing it and some of the videos </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_05> million views now what the [ __ ] should i </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> mudan in uh the uk as well yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah got a call we're gonna catch up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with him uh somehow he found two days </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> out of his schedule to uh program </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> himself out of editing and uh we flew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the way from estonia to come hang </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> out with us yeah my god my god he is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> machine i i i didn't realize this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i didn't appreciate this until like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> actually speaking to him in person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where he is he is insane i've never seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> someone with like a like a more strict </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> work ethic than he does oh yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that man never quits yeah i'm surprised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he still has like emotion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like you have to like throw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> humanity away to keep up with him he had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his videos in full time speed yeah he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> watches the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like how do you i don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> human brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i am convinced he's just jacked into the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> matrix because how do you edit in four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> times speed like you don't do that with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a mouse and keyboard you do that like in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like [ __ ] ghost of the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically you like jack yourself in and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like he edits the video in his mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's all i i'm convinced he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the one with premiere pro he does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> editing speed runs on his on his twitch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> channel yeah he edits like my whole of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my videos in like four hours yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because because like i remember i </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> like with a bunch of our mates as we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were like all catching up um and i was </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> stages right now like we'd be so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> advanced as a society </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> oh it's my birthday yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i've been like that for a while yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> that kind of like childish excitement of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like getting older anymore yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> slowly starts to turn into that oh god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm getting older yeah stage you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you i guess does it happen when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> get 30 is that when that happens um i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know like for me that's the only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 30 year old </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> as the only 30 year old here i remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it didn't didn't really hit me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until i was uh 29 i guess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so like ev every every year uh so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every year like we uh we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when when i lived in england we had like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this massive like party where we get to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> catch up with all of our friends in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> england so we'd like so we have this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> party every year yeah um and i remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it truly hit me because we were at this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> party uh and we're there for a few days </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so i was having a shower in the morning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i kind of it kind of just hit me that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the last time i'm gonna have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this catch up before i'm 30 in my 20s </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i just had this like full-on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] existential crisis in the shower </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where like i mean i take long showers i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i take long showers anyway but like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was just me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that day that was a long shot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like even for me that was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> long [ __ ] shower i think i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sydney like thought i got kidnapped or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i was just standing there just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i didn't know how to process that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was just i just it was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think i took like an hour-long shower </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then [ __ ] hell well your hands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> must have been sponged oh yeah they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they were the whole body </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then like off that shower which is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> completely fine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i was ready for my 30s afterwards um i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> also knew that i was like getting to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that point because i uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me and like a bunch of my friends who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> were all vaccinated so safe but uh we we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> rented out this like log cabin yeah like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the mountains in chiba and it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> really nice because you know i hadn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> really had it like a nightlife for about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a month since everything was like closed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> down it was like there's no point going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out to like restaurants or anything like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that at night so it's finally nice to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually you know [ __ ] get out and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah change of environment stuff like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that especially with your friends and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knew i was also getting to that point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because uh all i received was some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pieces of clothing two bottles of wine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and a bottle of whiskey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm like oh i'm getting to the point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like i see a bottle of whiskey and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like pog champion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just because like after a certain age </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you normally have everything you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right i mean like anything i'd want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is like yeah you want to buy me a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> porsche </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like a gift that a mate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't already have it's either like in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in an an acceptable price range it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't really exist it just gets bigger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and bigger it's either like you buy you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you buy them like a new job or a new car </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or a new house well what do you want you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean like i'd say another thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that happened to me in the uk that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you've just reminded me of is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i went to the uh went to the tescos to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh get my bottle of wine then they asked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me how old i was i never get id'd ever </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> asked me how old i was like 23 oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 25. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i legitimately forgot at one point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> how old i was turning i was like am i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> turning 27 or 28. yeah [ __ ] i don't </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> head to figure out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like i i'd literally like forgotten </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i had turned 30 because like i had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not been asked for id since i turned 30. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and uh so so yeah i i by like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> muscle memory i just started saying 20 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something and then like i had like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> darren brown moment where i just forgot </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> in um in japan for some reason i started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting id'd again when i went back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the uk i think i think i look older than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you sometimes i think what do you mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes sometimes sometimes i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> most days i think i think most people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> who watch who tune in to trash days for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the first time wait what's the oldest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> one everyone thinks that i'm older than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i am yeah which is fair enough yeah just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> means and everyone thinks god's like 20. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> cause i'm [ __ ] miserable that's right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm always complaining i can't wait til </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm 50. i'm going to complain about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> everything it's the beard man it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> beard no no you have a good beard too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but the thing is if i shave this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> off i look 17. well i look like a child </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there's plenty of trash days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> episodes where i don't have a beard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and i i i look at it i'm like whoa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah it's just like you shave your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beard instantly you just like lose five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like 10 i think i think maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like a 12 year old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas i feel if god came to a trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taste recording with a beard like ours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he'd look like a [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i've had like a five o'clock shadow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> before and uh yeah i don't know how that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i just don't like it when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my beard's too long you just throw an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> age man just just feels like i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you could you could kill it or you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could kill it i can kill it maybe i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> try one day yeah one one one randomly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe my mid 30s is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> next time we have like like a break when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we don't record trash taste i'll just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let my beard grow out and it'll just be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the dichotomy of like one trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taste episodes for the for the audience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what happened during this week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wow you're really aged during this week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> god just like does some doctor strange </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or some nonsense or something like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like a beard could weirdly suit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i know um i i'm just not a big fan of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> beards on me personally i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's i i also like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's there's this like patch where a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beard like can't grow on my on my chin </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> as well so i don't know how weird that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> would look if i grow it out there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit of patchwork as well around the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> place because like the reason the reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i have this patch is because as a kid uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> when i was a kid i got uh well it's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that big of an exciting story but my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chin got cut open </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> was on the playground fell on uh hit a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kid fell on the floor and then might </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> split </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> oh [ __ ] get my chin open um and so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> uh once that got closed up there's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this patch on my chin that just won't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> grow hair so i've always found it like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sticker just stick something just grab </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> something just take something we'll just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just grow it out and just like kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> bumble </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah break it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> bread it into the middle so it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> comes down like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe i'll probably will one day um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know if we should get into anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i watched an anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i forgot we're an anime podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what did you watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> squid game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> high rise invasion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] is that exactly what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] is that i watched high-rise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> invasion on netflix is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is that an actual anime i said look it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up the google it's got a japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i've never heard of this anime before so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so so what happened was is that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was like i was like i told myself i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna watch the first anime i see on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> netflix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> why what the [ __ ] is this and i've never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> seen this and so i watched it right and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh i was pleasantly surprised i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> quite enjoyed it really it wasn't it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't amazing but it was it was good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's and so when i when i when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> started watching it it was the it felt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the most 6.6 show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just good i had a fun time good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fun time it was very interesting and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> stupid at times and dumb but interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you should guys should uh check it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should we explain the plot to you please </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go go on sure whoa connor explaining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll leave it on your heart believe it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or not this is gonna be the most scuffed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> plot explanation of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any animation where are you still right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so this main character forgot her name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> riley wakes up on the top of a high-rise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> building and you you can you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go down the stairs of the high-rise you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> can only cross like wooden bridges to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get to other high-rise buildings right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and there's these dudes that are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wearing these masks that are like budget </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um anonymous looking masks yes smiley </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> masks and they're trying to kill you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and they're trying to they're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to kill you they're trying to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you to jump off the building by making </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you have such despair but that goes out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the window within like 10 seconds and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people they're starting to kill you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right so it's one of those things it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of those things where they build it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up to be like a really big plot point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like they want to make you feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> despair and jump yourself and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately they just come up to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like you jump off paris </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> these masks people just start killing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone and then it was like wait so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that wasn't that wasn't important </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then just people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> masks are like controlling people and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> we're trying to find out what's going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's some other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> uh they're all issac so it's all all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> all these characters why didn't you say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so earlier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all these characters come from a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different world they wake up on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> high-rise buildings and have to go from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> different high-rise and there's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> masks that control them and it's kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] but it's it was it was interesting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> enough i had a fun time i i you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> what it was nice watching a show and not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> caring if it was going to be good or bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i enjoyed it and the dub was very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> good very good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the dichotomy because i i think like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this was this was the longest stretch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where i went not watching an anime at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all and uh actually picked up a jrpg </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that uh i like got [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like tales of her eyes yeah is it was it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good it was [ __ ] amazing man why did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to say that now i have to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it it's it's like it's it's the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time i played a jrpg and like i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like and actually completed it oh no i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like i like i like not only i've not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> only completed it i think i'm like close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to 100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well my god like it's the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] jrpg where i i cared about it so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> much and i didn't want the journey to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> end that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 100 100 percented the [ __ ] fishing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mini game okay i caught that that's how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i caught every fish in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> game so i could see every skit that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was available </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the game okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> how many hours have you put in this game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh at the moment about 80 hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like for jrpg length that's actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not too bad that's not too bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like especially for a hundred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> percent run that's nice that's pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> short </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in like the past two weeks right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean what else was he going to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in quarantine man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no but it's it's uh i mean like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing that really surprised me is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it really got me to care about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game mechanics i'm just like i'm i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here for the story and characters yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i just got really absolutely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fans found out that games games can be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i just got really absorbed into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the combat system of this game and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like how did you trick my how did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you trick my non-gamer brain into caring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about this [ __ ] right because because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i've played so many tales games and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the reason i got it and tales was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it had like a real-time combat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> system yeah and that was i played uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brazilia and i didn't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and that was in the time where i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only really got into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> tails games because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every other jrpg was turned back com </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turn-based combat with random encounters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and tails was like no no no no how about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have a real-time battle system with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enemies that you can see when you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into a battle right and then that kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like as time gone on that became more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normalized in a lot of jrpgs like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know you see the modern final fantasy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's basically just an it's an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> action rpg with some turn-based systems </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> implemented into it and so for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> longest time i still play tails games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they weren't they didn't grab me as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much as say back in the old school days </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where this was the only type of jrpg </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there was that had this type of system </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so i i like my love for the channel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> series had like waned a bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so when i got tales of a rise i only got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it because people were just like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a new tales game and i'm like i'm a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tales fan maybe i'll just play this like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i'm i'm a tales fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm gonna ignore that for a second i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sorry i'm sorry i'm glad you said it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> before i did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i just kept saying tales and i just kept </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking i was in my head i was i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just imagining [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like i'm a big tales </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like if i wasn't in quarantine i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wouldn't have played it and then on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first day i just like i played it for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a good 10 hours and i was like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh no i'm invested </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if there's one thing you don't want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be invested in it's the jrpg because you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just have to basically write off like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> two three weeks of your life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if that happens pretty much and it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's been such a long time where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like when you're so absorbed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> into a game that every waking moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not playing the game you you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either playing the game or you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking about playing the game i missed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that feeling yeah yeah and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] great and uh the combat system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in this is like closer to something like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> devil may cry than it is like previously </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you can you can you can do like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] ridiculous amounts of combos in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> this game right can i kind of can i go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the game mechanics do you care about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the game mechanics at all um sure i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's better than you talking about aero </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'd love to hear how you like it okay so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> most tales games that i played before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like [ __ ] button mashing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you press yeah that's what i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like about it yeah the last time i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> played it yeah and you can get through a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of this game through just button </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mashing and then like it there's there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this really weird difficulty curve where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the later part parts of the game you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like before in every tails games you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just get away with like tapping one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> button tapping special attack anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that but then they've built they've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> layered so many different systems onto </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this combat system from like previous </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tales games that you can you you realize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can just start layering [ __ ] over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like things over things everything's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything so they introduce you to you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you already have you can only do a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> certain amount of moves for before your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> character goes back into a rest state </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right so you can you can only do like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> three basic attacks and enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enough basic enough special attacks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before your meter runs dry but then if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you juggle the enemy you add more basic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> attacks on on top of that right and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on top of that you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> group you have group attacks as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where people in your party can also join </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in on an attack and then what i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realize is that tails added this system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can switch to another person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mid like like mid battle so you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to pause the game to switch to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another character you can literally it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the top of one button you can switch to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another person so you base you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically chain combos end combo with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one person then switch to like do a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> special attack with another person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> switch to that person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so the system awards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> awards people who are able to change </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really good combos because if you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your combo meter long enough then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can do basically a finishing attack yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right it looked kind of like genting a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> little bit yeah that's that's the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's basically like it did it was a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like engine except having except not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having just one person but having four </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that your chain when you're playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> against him from how much yeah that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you've changed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but there's a lot it's like way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more in depth than genji i would say it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it does have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> some similarities to the gentian combat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> system but it's like way more in-depth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> get combos that are like way longer than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> genji you get like 100 hit combos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes the only thing that i found </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really funny and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know if this is the whole game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i was watching someone stream it on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> twitch and they were fighting this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> dragon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and during this fight every single </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> character was saying their voice lines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at every single point yeah and i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like what the [ __ ] is this i can't hear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything everyone is just screaming in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> their own attacks yeah is that that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> happening all the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah pretty much that's pretty standard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for a job but i couldn't hear anything i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't hear what anyone was saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because everyone was shouting their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> attacks i was like what is this i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the same with like uh like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> xenoblade as well right like when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're fighting that [ __ ] i can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch because that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it xenoblade annoys me watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> xenoblade because i'm just hearing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> at the same time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you know you like that no i can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because i can't hear what everyone's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> saying it's just noise you don't have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hear what they're saying i i i can't if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i wanted to i can't hear it it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not like they're giving like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> important information i just wish that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like i don't know when i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> watching as a i don't know from a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> viewing experience it was very annoying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least right from a gaming news </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> probably he didn't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i think if you're i think if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're watching it yeah as a viewer it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> might get a little bit annoying because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the only thing you're focusing on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but again it's not like they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna be like they're gonna drop like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> huge narrative plot points as they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm your dad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i know i was just like this is too loud </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> shut up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like on top of that as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes uh sometimes the characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will have conversations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as they're screaming as they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> screaming their attacks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean there's there is a lot of things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going on i love that i love that about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tales yeah this kind of campaign that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the anime side that i live for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know yeah there's something super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> campy about it that i love it it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> one person is like being like hey that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was a good shot and the other one's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> he's like all right you're not listening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sounds pretty cool though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like a little better uh combat system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than before yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't i don't trust people who prefer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um turn-based combat over that i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what's wrong with you who hurt you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i didn't say anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> except for persona we haven't figured </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> out a way to make it fun so we keep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> using the same shitty thing because we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know it sort of works but like no one's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't like turn-based combat i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know i'm just used to it so much to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> point where i like but that's the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though i think that's that's that's why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people i get it if you didn't grow up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with it it's [ __ ] annoying yeah and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it's just because it's one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the it's a thing that we haven't figured </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> out a better way and i still feel that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some games the whole real-time combat in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the way it's still kind of jank at times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it sounds like it's it's good it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really good like they finally figured it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out a little bit yeah it's it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good because because they teach you the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basics and then they don't teach you all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these like more advanced techniques that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can do to like basically extend your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> extend your combos and like make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flashier moves but they give you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> gameplay incentives like i said like if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get a combo for long enough without </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stopping it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you can do a finishing move on an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enemy and like when the when the high </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> health it's harder than when they're low </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> health so the common meter builds up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> faster when they're low health so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when when you sometimes you start off a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> battle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and depending on how well you can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your combo off because when when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kill one enemy with a finishing move </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that makes it easier to do the next </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enemy and the next enemy it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a domino effect right so you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can depending on your the difficulty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you start off a battle well you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clear the enemy so fast or you'll you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can like get ko'd really easily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depending on like how well you start off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your how are you starting for your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> attacks on your combos which is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just something that i never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experienced before in a tales game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because tails was always i'm playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i like it and it's anime and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's jr </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the combat the combats here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just is just to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like forget making me forget about the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fact that i just hate grinding and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> combats and like yeah i don't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> writing and turn-based battles but this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one was just it it's legit good game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can see why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the closest thing tails has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> got to like a mainstream release </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it is a legitimate game that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think a lot of people who don't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like jrpgs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would like um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i've been tempted ever since they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> announced that i'm just like i can't do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it to myself do it i have so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] jrpgs lined up that i still need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to play i still haven't played the </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> they're like okay there's five more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jrpgs i bought sega uh bass fish not </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> taste special we do high score on sega </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fishing bass fishing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> look at that game look at that can we </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> of new smash players </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean i i you know i don't it's </SPEAKER_02>
