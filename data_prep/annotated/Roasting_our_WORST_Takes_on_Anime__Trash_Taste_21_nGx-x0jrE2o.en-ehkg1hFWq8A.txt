<SPEAKER_05> - Have you ever cry wanked? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't dare try, to mix the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We know how easy it is for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He hasn't read metamorphosis. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Read metamorphosis
you'll know the definition </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of a cry wank. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> without breaking them

<SPEAKER_04> then three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whoo controversial. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing)
- Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you gate keeping
(Gigguk laughing) this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What if I wanna watch episode four </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then go back to episode one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro you're not a real
fan (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You got to start from part one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then part two all the way to part 20. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I watch halfway through part three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry, I'm sorry Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're a real fan, if
you see me over here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a special episodes, then we
know if you're a real fan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you don't know what
we're talking about, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry Joey.
- [Host] This is bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are we talking about today? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, what we're
gonna talk about today Joey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We hardly ever know what
we're gonna talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like we have a
few ideas we want to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we'll save the special ones coming up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But, I mean yesterday, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna tell you a little story boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, yeah, for it's
Connor's Story Time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's getting graphic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Connor's Story Time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I went to the DMV. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gathered around the camp, oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) This is
already sounding horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is not a campfire stories. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is already sound horrible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So as you guys know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> none of us have the
ability to drive in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we all have the licenses
in our own respective country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I thought well, one of
us needs to do it, I'll do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like driving, Garnt hates driving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and Joey is just Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So Joey just stands there being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't want to do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey doesn't want to spend
a whole day at a DMV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughs) And more probably
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My relationship with driving is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's literally serves a purpose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I don't care if I can
get from point A to point B </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a way that's like other than driving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or someone else can drive me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't care if I have to
drive, I'll fucking do it but-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can afford an Uber now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm convinced that you
wanted to become a rich person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just to get a chauffer (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like, eventually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the dream right?
- That's the dream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, like okay I don't hate driving, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I hate is parking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My gods, like I can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just like at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The thought of parking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes 'cause I suck at parking, Okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I barely passed my test </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when it came to like parallel parking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) The thoughts
of parallel parking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> gives me nightmares. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I wake up in a
cold sweat and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what if the car doesn't fit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd make a fool of myself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like spending 10 minutes
trying to get into the slot, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because everyone's been
on the other end, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Where you're trying to
watch someone parallel park </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like, come
on, it's not that hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when you actually
go to do it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, it's that hard (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I somehow nail like the hard parking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then take 15 attempts for
the shittiest easiest parking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when there's like a 100 people around me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just watching me like really embarrassing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I wanted to get my license </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you know, I wanted
to have the options open. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I feel like you can still explore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of Japan without a car. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Host] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just some places,
you know the further I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Once you're outside of Tokyo,
you pretty much need a car. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Becomes a little more difficult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if you wanna
really explore a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if you want to stick
to the main tourist stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> there's this buses and
stuff and you'll be fine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I wanted to drive and
I mean, nothing goes better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with my Beep Boop Daft
Punk music than driving. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) I
love driving with music man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so like smacking
that wheel, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Smacking that wheel is
like, you're like a fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you are like a dad.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I love it, I love all of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So I thought, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to get my license, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause if you have a
British license in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and a select few of the
countries, a lot of European ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they said like America,
but only Hawaii and Alaska. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like, so only Hawaii
and Alaska can do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're from any of the countries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where you don't, from those countries, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to do a test. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why Hawaii and Alaska? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have no idea, I don't
think it was Hawaii or Alaska, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was Alaska and some other
country, some other state. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is really confusing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm pretty sure
don't they all drive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the same side of the road? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I thought so, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause the reason why American. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe there something we don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause the reason why Americans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> have to do a driving test is because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we drive on the other
side of the road, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But Alaska drive on the same
side of the road as Japan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Alaskans let us know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so I had to go to the DMV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I knew it was going
to be a stressful process, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it always is with any driving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's just universal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I can only imagine how
stressful it is in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) because the
extra layers you have to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, because you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it was already hell in my own country, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably gonna be hell
again in Japan, times two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I have to take a translator with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is so awful.
- I'm so glad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the translator was not me (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was gonna ask Joey, but
then another friend offered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But then I was like
oh, you ended up at DMV? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry I'm busy, I'm busy that
day, I got caught, my bad man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So first I gonna ask, how
long were you there for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got there at 8:20 in the morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why so early? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it your line off?
- So </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes, so right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm not sure if
it's because of COVID, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but right now only 10 people are allowed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get a foreign license a day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the whole prefecture.
- Wow, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's like first come first serve. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so whoever serve first, gets it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you don't, you have to
come back at 2:30 and wait </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but they give out the 2:30 slots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the 9:00 a.m
- [Host] In the morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I was in the 2:30 slot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh shit!
- Jesus! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I got, I queued up at 8:20. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was told, on the website it says 9:30, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get there at 9:30. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I called them up and I asked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hey what time should I get that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They said, get that for like eight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I got there at 8:20 because I thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh it's no one's gonna be there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was already like 14 people
lined up when I got there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I was in the second bunch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they only give out 10 licenses a day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in the whole prefecture, which
is like millions of people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for foreigners and it's like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How is this a thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why only 10? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they issue the
first 10 like I go home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least it wasn't like
the bullshit like you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know when they did like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a Gotcha Game and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Here's a ticket and
if you win the ticket, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you have a chance to get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow, wow, you'll see well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll tell you more about the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, go on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's like an hour away from me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I have to get up at like 6:00 AM </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which is way over my like comfort zone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can wake up at eight and be fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like anything before 7:30. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like shit the whole day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I get that and we line up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I have to wait
an hour to get my ticket. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I have to wait an hour to wait more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So then I went to Coco's Diner, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like Coco's Richmond, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think.
- [Host] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Went there, stayed there
for three and a half hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Host] Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Came back to the place,
waited another hour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Finally got to go in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As I'm going in, this
couple is like screaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the employees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Hosts] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like what the fuck or
something in Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remembered some of it from anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) They were
saying in the bad anime words. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, that's a nappy I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what happened it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> apparently didn't have
the right documents. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> But before we went in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they gathered us all around and were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey some of you are gonna be
rejected today for no reason." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They literally said that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They said.
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - They said, "We might reject
you and not explain why." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is the issued demonetization? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean,
I've come here all day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you've to bring like
so many fucking documents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So you have to get like
your license translated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at a different building,
wait a few days for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Go to the ward office,
which is another building, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> get proof that you live
where you say you live. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Hosts] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bring your other license, your passport, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> literally every single documentation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you were ever a person to begin with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And yeah and then they
grilled me for like an hour, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like asking me if I--
- Asking what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well they so a part to
get the foreign license </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to prove that
you are in the country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you got your license
for six months after the fact. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I brought tons of paperwork, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> proving that I was in the
U.K at the time when I got it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in for six months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they just kept grilling me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and asking me pointless
questions, what I thought. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But they asked like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Did you have like a provisional license? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Which in the U.K and I
think in America as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Australia too.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You got a license
before the actual license. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're like, did you have one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, obviously I
had one, I had to drive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who doesn't?
- What a dumb question. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Part of the official process, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you need a provisional before
you get a full license. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think a lot of
countries would let you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> get the full thing without
doing it and I said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll speak about Thailand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I'm like, yeah of course I had that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "How long did it take
you to get your license" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What do you mean how long? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Did it take like a week </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or did you do lessons over a long time? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, I did
lessons over a long time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Then they're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, how long did you have
that provisional form?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, why are you ask? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Who cares? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Who cares how long? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got the full license? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I'm like, I had it for five years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And she was like (snorts) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then she asked, "why did
you have it for so long?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, why does
it matter how long like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because in the U.K, we don't have ID. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't carry around ID. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So most people will get
the provisional license </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if they don't intend to drive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm here explaining like
a cultural difference to her. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, so what did you say? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I explained that I'm like in the U.K, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't really have ID,
so people will get the ID. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's what Japanese
people do as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it real? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's a lot
of like what we call. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why I'm I being grilled for this thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - In Japan, a lot of people are
like known as paper drivers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which means they have the license, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but they don't have it to drive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> They just have it as a form of ID. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, in the U.K people
get provisional licenses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because we.
- That's where I got. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We use licenses to prove that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we can get into bars and pubs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's pretty much the only reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for provisional licenses.
- And even Australia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so I had to wait an hour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, cool,
I'm it's all going well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she seems to be, you know happy with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She's like, "Yeah okay, yeah, no problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Just come back in two days." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you mean come back in two days? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you didn't even get it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't get it to
today, I didn't get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you haven't got it yet? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No
- After waiting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how long did you wait? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I left at 4:00 p.m and
I got there at 8:00 a.m </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so that is eight hours away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So eight hours? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like eight hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You wasted a whole day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I lost a whole day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To not getting a license. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To get the paperwork,
to get the license. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I remember you
telling me just before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you were getting this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a whole of bunch of fetch quests, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is why they love. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> In fact, this is why all the RPGs in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have a bazillion fetch quests. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause living here is
a fucking fetch quest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every time you wanna do anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, okay get
the prerequisite items. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which you they're all
in different locations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because of course they are, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they're not all in
the government building </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because that would be so easy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that will make life too simple. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why Gotcha Game work here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you even have the waiting time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the loading time
where you're like think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you got all the items and then
you have to like put it in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like, fucking yeah,
you gotta a craft the item </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and you've gotta wait until the item </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is finished being crafted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you pull the
DOD Gotcha (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you have to wait to 2:30. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - So they said I have to
come back on Wednesday, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is tomorrow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm going there tomorrow
to do the eye test. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's it, I do the eye test </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and once I prove I'm not
fucking blind, I get my license </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Imagine if they just
rejects you after that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would fucking lose temper </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you basically spend eight hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for someone to tell you
come back in two days? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, basically, I know the
DMV is bad in all countries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in U.K I would never have it that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It wasn't that bad especially
with how many documents </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you needed to grab before just
to get your license slide, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just be given a license as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's crazy because like Nabi, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who went with you is a friend of ours, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like when he went, he
had such an easy time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I guess it's because
he got up before COVID. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think they've made it
a lot slower, from COVID, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like apparently and they also told me that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason, because of COVID, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the amount of people
applying has gone up a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well yeah, because no one can travel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of the country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So therefore they wanna
travel inside the country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah true, but I guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would have thought the other way around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah it's just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Speaking to you has made me less, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entirely put me off from
wanting to get a job. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm glad at least someone in Trash Taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now has a license 'cause
we're just gonna ask you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to show for us anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want it, I even when
I don't need something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to just do it because
if I have the free time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know there's gonna be up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I never wanna be in the point in my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like, I need something
and it's gonna take. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I mean, don't get me
wrong, I'm like that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I'm not going to go
to a DMV for eight hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like, come back for
an eye test two days later. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't know they were gonna do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That doesn't sound worthy to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm glad you went through the pain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like I said, like, I don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now we know not to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, now I know not to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I like driving for me is
a stressful experience anyway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but that's probably because
I've spent most of my time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> driving in Thailand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I never actually
drove so much in the U.K </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause like I grew up in Brighton </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and then went to London for my job search. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So I've never needed to be in a place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I drive frequently
until I moved to Bangkok. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my God, driving in just
Southeast Asia, in general, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just nothing like driving in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or driving in the U.K or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So let me describe what it is
like driving in one of these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kinds of countries.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so in Thailand,
we don't have road rules, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we have road suggestions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's kind of so we
technically have rules, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but whether people follow them or not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is up to the individual driver. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a Mario Kart
with like a lot more death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is basically, so like
you know how you change lanes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like a system for
example, changing lanes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You signal and then the
person like whether it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Backs off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, the person backs off whatever, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like whoever has the right of way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The rights of way in Thailand goes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay we're gonna play this
game of chicken, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] (laughs) Oh, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So imagine I wanna change lanes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or someone else wants to change lane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's a car just like behind them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like in the same lane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the person's gonna start changing lanes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and either one person backs off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the person changing lane
backs off or we're gonna crash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so there's no rule to
say who has to back off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So one of them is gonna back
off or you're gonna crash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's basically who has the bigger balls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like not give way or give away </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who's going to be the bigger man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah exactly,
exactly (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is wild, I think
like Thailand looks scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's other countries
that even worse I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's like, I think in Saudi Arabia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the number one cause of
death is car accidents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wouldn't be surprised, I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's crazy because I don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any other country it's even not there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I went to the
Philippines a couple years ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to go see Yankees family and
we had to drive through Manila. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that was one of the
most terrifying things ever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because not only is there no
lanes and it's the same thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's just whoever
gets in there first, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but there's also people just on the road </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just in the middle of
the road trying to cross. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The worst thing is like
the people in the middle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of the road who have just no fear of death </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then motorcycles as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Motorcycles are like the
fucking, like annoying housefly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you just can't
like fucking swat away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they're always and you
always need to be aware of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like driving in Bangkok,
you just have to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just have to mask the ultra instinct. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They just every driver, just
needs to master ultra instinct. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just have to like the rain men. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - (Joey laughing) The
fucking men turned on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why they can all drive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like the fucking observation hockey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like permanently turned
on when you're driving. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's not just the motorcycle either, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like one it's like a motorcycle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's normally for like max two people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but somehow have like eight people on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like sometimes there's
just the motorcycle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's just like the
entire family (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> on the motorcycle plus the chauffeur. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude that would be wild. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a clown car but a motorcycle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That would stressed
me out so fucking much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like it's funny 'cause
Bangkok, living in Bangkok, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you often take motorcycle taxis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though in any other
country, you would not take it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I described Bangkok
is like the only place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been to in the world, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I will willingly
risk my life everyday </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going into a motorcycle taxi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I can save myself from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting in an hour of traffic.
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the kind of city
it is during rush hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's just given me a huge, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't say fear of driving, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but just every time like
I think about driving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just gives me a cold sweat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, oh, I got to get
back on that road man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or you've just like perfected </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your like dodging techniques. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here in the U.K by some asshole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah I go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So we were on, I was driving two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we have like a yearly house party </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where a lot of my friends
in the U.K catch up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was sitting in the
car with Alan, my Editor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Alex, Alan's girlfriend,
Sydney and D Revel House. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so we were on like a country roads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we had just like there
was a car in front of us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we just stopped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I like did like a
kind of like a sudden stop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause the car in front of us,
like did a very quick stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then D was about
say nice driving Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And as he was, as like the
sound was leaving his mouth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (mimicking a car crash)
a fucking car just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tears in my car and it fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> destroys my car.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And (laughs) I like my
car is fucking totaled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the car in front of us
has the audacity to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, this was your fault by the way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "when are you paying up?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the car behind us was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so during the interview
when the police came, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we called the police, we've got you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone got like checked up an ambulance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and apparently he just,
he was going like 60 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or 70 down a country road </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he just had his eyes off the road. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, "Yeah, I
just took my eyes off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "the road for a second </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "and who knew a car could
creep up on me in one second?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh dear, it's terrifying
in the country roads. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like I learned to drive in London </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I also drive a lot in Wales. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But like, those roads in Wales are scary </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause they're all like thick
trees and really tight roads, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially like Wales and then
probably in Devin as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We were in there like
that's like fucking trucks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> coming all the time on these roads. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a one way road or? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's two but when
you get the big trucks, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like you kind of just stop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It might as well be a one-way road, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah.
- So that you avoid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the road ditch, so
sometimes you'll go in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then normally 60 'cause
like their national speed limit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 60 miles right?
- Miles per hour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they'll just
be like trucks coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you really have to like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like truck drivers
in every country are like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They don't give a fuck
'cause why would they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They win every time (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> If I had a rock to destroy paper </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of course I'm gonna pick rock
to fucking kill everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're like the jokes in
the school hallway, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you have to move out of the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they don't gonna move (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean that was the only car crash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been in but there's
been many, many close calls </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as you can probably imagine in Bangkok. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like the health and safety in Bangkok, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially on the road, is very worrying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - How does an ambulance get to you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) If you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've wondered that exact
same question, during shower. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Motorcycle as an ambulance,
like get in the back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess you just gotta
a fucking bleed out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the road, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause what's even scarier all right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the taxi drivers in Bangkok. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It causes such a roulette wheel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, so for one, you'd
expect one of some, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> one of the most dangerous
cities to drive in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to have a lot of like safety measures </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on the public transports right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So most taxis you go in the back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and there's no seat belts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Some of the closest near
death experiences I've had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have been on a fucking taxi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because taxi drivers they don't
get paid the most as well, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so they work ridiculously long hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I remember this one time I was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I had a night out and
we stayed out till about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like 3:00 a.m, 4:00 a.m
drinking at some IZakiya </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in like Bangkok whatever
and we had to go home. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so we get a taxi home. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the good thing about driving back home </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> in like the middle of like 4:00 a.m, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is it's normally driving
there it takes two hours, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but when there's no traffic,
it takes 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's kind of like the time we had on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you don't factor in traffic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But we get in, it's me and Sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we get in this taxi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this guy just seems really quiet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then we get to the highway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's doing like fucking
80 to a 100 miles an hour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on the freeway, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then Sydney is like
asleep in the taxi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's just me and it's complete silence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he's just starts
like swerving a bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know that thing where. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you wake up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like whoa, whoa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like okay, we could
have crashed right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I asked him, are you okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, "Yeah,
it's I'm completely good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I've just been up for like 36 hours." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pull over pull over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whoa, whoa, hold on a second </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and to explain something about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to explain like something
about Thai culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We have this thing called
a Mapping Lie Attitude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which the closest translation is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (speaking in foreign language) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's okay kind of attitude,
which you know it's great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're on holiday you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because the reason Thailand's so great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're on holiday is
cause everyone's so relaxed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, it's stress free. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But there are some situations </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's very not in my situation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this was one of those situations. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm asking him, are you okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you sure you don't wanna pull over? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We can get another taxi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like "map and lie,
map and lie, map and lie" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like bruh, this is a
very not map and lie situation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) right now that we're in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could go next to him the whole time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like slapping his cheeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I was actually in the back seat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No seat belt by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This taxi did not have a seat belt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this guy just I told him to slow down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he goes, "Okay, I'll slow down." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So he goes from a 100 miles
an hour to 80 miles an hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like bro, like brilliant, brilliant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everything is not map and lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, he's like
map and lie, map and lie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like every five
minutes he would just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I could see him nodding
off, nodding off to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (mimicking a sleepy head) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is where you get in the front seat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stare at him like this,
like the owl just like fucking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like Bangkok has like a highway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like a elevated highway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I couldn't just tell him to stop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and like and we get another taxi, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause we're in the middle of the highway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you're a fucking Japanese taxi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> he'll stop on the highway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They don't give fuck that crazy here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so basically it
was the most stressful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> half hour of rides I've ever been on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney was like
stress-free, she was asleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She could have died in her sleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sydney was the only one
who was map and lying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a good way to go
(all laughing) I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I know what's up
like fucking pissed out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my mind at 4:00 a.m being like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to have this conversation
with this taxi driver. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like I was just
trying to keep him awake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he was telling me like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh yeah, you know I've got like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "two kids waiting for me at home." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, dude
after this taxi drive, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go home to your fucking kids. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just think about your kid's.
- Sleep, for fuck's sake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Please just think about
your kids right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - My God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And yeah, that was one
of the near life you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That experiences I had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, can I come to
Thailand will be great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, bro, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You make us sound like it's
fucking Jason Statham Movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time you talk about it, holy shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fast and furious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Keeping this man
awake to save your life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is this? (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll said earlier like Japanese taxis, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they just stop anywhere,
if you noticed that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They have the jocks in the skill, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I tell them to
stop around somewhere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they like take that literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they'll stop in the middle
of the fucking busy highway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they'll be like, here you are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like what are you doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Get to a side road or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you don't specify like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can you stop like down the road? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> If you just say stop, they'll
be like, okay stopping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - They stop, if I say like
(laughs) tomorrow, they'll stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, we're in the
middle of an intersection </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe you should like, move forward a bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He did that when we went
to the Roman last week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he stopped at the intersection, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just stopped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm like, I'm not
getting out of the car, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we're in a fucking intersection. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - (all laughing) Like bro (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know 'cause they follow
road rules so strictly here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then for some reason
taxi drivers just don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's funny cause I noticed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on the British government
website, when you go to Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it says be careful of taxi drivers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because they just stop anyway,
especially when driving. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because if you're behind
a taxi driver in Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're driving be careful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> He'll probably just stop like full force, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just full of it's crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah it's like the like road rules </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> or like who has the right of way? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Kind of confusing me sometimes
and okay zebra crossing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Zebra crossings in every
country have a different meaning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't know what it means in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like so to explain in the U.K,
if there's a zebra crossing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the pedestrian always
has the right of way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you never need to fear for your life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're near the zebra crossing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're taught to stop,
as the driver you stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if you see someone walking
near it, like slow down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly, but you know
in like Southeast Asia, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> zebra crossings mean nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a suggestion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a suggestion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In Japan, I don't know
what it means either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes they stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're supposed to
stop, but they don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Others this is where I've stood like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> at the front of the
several crossing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you want people to stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and like five causes
possible, I'm like can I go? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have to like start
walking in the road </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they'll stop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> So I realize I'm playing fucking chicken. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought I was walking
the road and be like, halt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have the right of way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cease. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cease, (all laughing) My Lord. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And then go, it's weird, I
don't know why you think that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, considering how
strict that road was on there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everyone leaves so
much room between the cars, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I noticed that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In the U--
- It's like a car's worth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, in the U.K it's like this much, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in Japan it's like I
leave a car, at least to car. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why I'm kind of glad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that Japan doesn't have like
roundabouts, can you imagine? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like just how much of-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one would give way,
everyone would just be waiting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for someone to come in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, don't stop, don't stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Please, please go ahead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know because there were this is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if it's an actual road rule </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I want to preface, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if it's an actual road rule, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but in Australia we were taught </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and some people were taught, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that when you're in a roundabout right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Usually it's like whoever's
in the roundabout first right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's basically like once
you're in the roundabout, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to give away to whoever's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the roundabout, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But in Australia, some
people were taught that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you always have to give way
to the person on your right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, but then
what if this four people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the roundabout? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who is gonna give way? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's kind of like, if you see them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're far enough way
on the right-hand side, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess go this is why I hate roundabouts, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you know like super
like rock solid logic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Australia is the land
of fucking roundabouts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We have a roundabout everywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have so many in
the U.K it's kinda like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you just gotta be like,
are you Americans like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fucking you guys talking about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Basically you just like kind
of have to you see a car coming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like, do I think I can
get this car in gear and go? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That just brings an
extra layer of stress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to my drive.
- The worst </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause t's like playing
a quick time event. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And if you failed a quick
time event, you just struck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just crash.
- Crash. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey drives automatic, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so he's lucky
- Oh God, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause the worst part
is cause you obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have to stop versus the
time of the roundabout. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So you're like in, you're not in gear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you're like, you see
a car and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen this car, I
have to quickly decide </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whether I can get in gear and go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) And if I'm fast
enough to not make that guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> slow down too much,
'cause it's just a mess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's easy for me 'cause I
just like, can I make it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll just press the go pedal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Press the go pedal just
get in (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah, I did my driving
test for a manual car, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And this driving test,
put me off driving manual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for my entire fucking life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay to explain, I think you're allowed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> 16 minor offenses, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 16? Oh, oh when you're taking the test. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Minor, minor when you're driving test. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What registers as a minor offense? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like not indicating? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no not that's a major one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe going a little too
early and too much time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Stuff that doesn't matter,
but if you do a lot of them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it would be like your shit driver. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Stop, that one cause an accident. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So if your tires like hit a curb, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's a major
- Now that's a major offense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that's the level of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like a minor
offense is something that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't cause a crash or
anything like that I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I got 13 on my. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got 13 on my driving test. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought I've failed, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I'm gonna test the limit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I swear like, 'cause
I was so fucking stressed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was my first time driving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was my first attempt at
the driving test as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember this,
there was always one road, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was super fucking terrified
would be on my driving test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And of course it was all my driving test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so driving a manual
car, it's a hill start. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a hill start into a roundabout. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, same same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like that, I remember when I pulled up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and normally I hope that's
the roundabout fucking clear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Of course it's not clear, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you're playing about five
different mini games at once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you stop the car, if
you go too early, go too late </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or do any of that shit, you fail the test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that like the experience
of having to drive manual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you 'cause we've
driving manual you are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> constantly playing a mini game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I just wanna shut my brain off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna stress free driving experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, that's why I've
driven automatic my entire life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since then basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never driven
automatic so long it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- I'm too there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It'll be like fucking putting
the antenna on in Marriott. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So how do we crash? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How do I crash this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm on my way to the driving test, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did like everything wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I didn't indicate, I ran a red light. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucked up on a roundabout,
nearly close to crash. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My driving instructor was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's okay if you have to do it twice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know it's and then I got
like two minors, that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like went in like
men mode, like focus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just like killed it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, wow okay damn, good at this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for this very small point during the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I must attempt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - As long as it's not as bad as my uncle, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he like my uncle like he
failed his first driving test </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and (laughs) you want to guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how he failed his first driving test? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did he do? Did he crash? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like, you know when
you do you start at the DMV, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like in your driving test </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or do you just started like a random road? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We start at a random road for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wherever you parked your car? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So in Australia you
start at the actual DMV. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you have to like
go out of the DMV driver, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come back to the DMV and then
once you're back at the DMV, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then that's the end of the test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> My uncle went out of the exit (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of the DMV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So he got in the car, he started it up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drove out two seconds later,
it was like, "you failed." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because he drove out of the exit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry he dropped out of the entrance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds better than
what happens in the U.K. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> In the UK, if you do a
major, like major mistake </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you know, you've done it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You have to complete the test. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They don't tell you,
you failed immediately. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You just, you could like do something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you'd know you failed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you still just have to
go through the entire test </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knowing that you've done it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, because in Australia,
the moment you fail, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they just immediately tell you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they tell you to drive back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because to the instructor, they're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> oh sweet we finished 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can take a break. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So they changed the U.K
tests from when you did it now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So when I had to do it, there
was like a portion of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was with like a sat nav </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there was another part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they were like
telling me the directions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hated it when they were
telling me directions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, why do I need
to be tested on this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like testing my
ability to use like a quilt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I'm never gonna
use this (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like just give me the little
robot that talks to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I can see where the map is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know what the like,
when you say right to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's 10 seconds before my brain goes dumb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, right, right, right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right now? Right now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like this right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like my right arm this way right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like this my brain is like
bro when I here directions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause when I'm driving, I'm like bro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm trying to change gears the fuck up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one the testing is for
fucking backseat drivers right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because they like it's
all right, it's all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like yo, can you charge
my mix tape at least kind of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They tell you the thoughts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So that was pretty sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I failed the test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At least I'd wanna put the mixed tape. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just slip that in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll give you the mix tape
for free if you let me pass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not like hook up my
looks or something come on, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, I got you (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Stop playing all the fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime openings and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh fuck love this
opening, I'll turn right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So yes, so yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So now I know not to go to
the fucking DMV in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you for taking the bullet for us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Now we don't have to hire a
chauffeur for Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We just have you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can't wait to go tomorrow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, moving on from driving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was a pretty big tangent, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have an announcement, gentlemen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I think after 10, 12, 13 years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I may have a new best girl of all time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait who was it before? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Senjogahara, so, ever since. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like white bread too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So ever since the very first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've watched back
Monogatari, like Senjogahara </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> has been my wife for you,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's always been the top tier girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and like people would come close. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughs) Where are you going with this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But no one has come
close to dethroning her. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But recently I caught up to
the rental girlfriend, Manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think that she's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she's is in contention for
being like my best girl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of all time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, which like leads
me to the question like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when did you first know that
you have like a best girl? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I know who's yours is Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I know Connor is losing his mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) At this question. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like where people
were like on the forums </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like how did you know you were in love? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what made you feel
like you were in love? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's like the stomach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is love? (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is love and when
did you first fall in love? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I mean, first of all,
I'm surprised Senjogahara </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like your wife
because I always thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was fucking Oscar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean like Oscar was someone
who I could just respect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for Connor is dying in his corner here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oscar is my wife and she's
just someone I respect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oscar is like 15. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it depends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the biggest, no officer she's a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - She's a drawing (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean I don't know if I
wanna open up that debate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause that debate is a
fucking landmine of takes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah I mean like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We can open that up for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know if I want to man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor and Garnt laughing)
I'm in the worst position </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) I'm in the worst
position for that argument. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you know there good
defense for yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, yeah but I
also don't really care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like you don't need a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like you don't need a defense </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to be like, yes, this is my girlfriend. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't care what you think, I love her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I don't think
it's like, I'm not trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the people who are like,
yeah, it's pedophilia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like I think
there's gotta be something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> little sauce about dude like,
yeah they're my wife who. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not gonna willingly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know walk into a
courtroom and being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> here is my defense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your honor, she was a drawing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Which you know like, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your honor I have a birth certificate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's technically (laughs) 900 years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do think there's a huge difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like having a wife and
you know like sexualizing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, a wife who is like a character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who is a female I guess most of the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who is just really dig. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get that, I get that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and for me it's
always been Senjogahara </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because I like from watching back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when I got three like
I love the personality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and, huh?
- Why, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That was the biggest huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Huh, just like how
dare you even question? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How dare you even question? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I can, you know think
of some excuses when I need. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just because like, I
interactions with Arararagi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were some of the most entertaining reacts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like interactions I had seen
in anime up to that point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it was like
the way she was written </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the way like it really,
what really sold me on the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was basically Senjogahara
interaction with Arararagi </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and how their romance developed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and how her character
was explored as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was just something that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like her character
really resonated with me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I think that's what
really a waifu wears. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a character who really
like resonates with you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on a personal level. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like you don't necessarily
view them as a life partner </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You're just like damn man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just a character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that whatever they do,
you just fucking love. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like they can say or do anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and just how they react
and how they are like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like the
highest tier of Sydney. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I saw all of that and was like nah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give me the one who sucks my neck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Nice character development bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> How about you suck my neck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Senjogahara is not my waifu, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I fuck love her as a character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I love how everything she does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and says is deadpan as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I love about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's her deadpan
delivery and deadpan humor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which really drew her
to Mike drew her to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then it was exploring
another side of the car </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to a more vulnerable side,
which was made me like, okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm simping i want you to be happy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I totally get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll take that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Monogatari is really
good at that though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why there's so many waifus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now, I agree, it's like
every time like Shinobu Oshino </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> came on screen, like
everything she said and did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, I fucking love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why I can't
explain it to you in words, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That powerful that when
you're done watching it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like thinking about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah,
she's such a good character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you had I've never had character, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like waifu or not like female or not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've just like kind of resonate ways. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gonna have a husbando as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I have a husbando. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah I think so, I think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think that I can't name them (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Off the top of my head. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I know like can't really
think of any immediately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you have a husbando? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd have to think about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause my husbando is
Usui from Kaichou Maids. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So Malin is like, all
right, that's a good choice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, what's it called in English? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kaichou Maids Sama is a president, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is the, is a maid, is a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I've seen that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do want to explain this character? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so Usui is like
the, I guess Kaichou Maids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> some it's based off the shows Manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from like the early 2000s, I believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the anime is from
like the early 2000s. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But basically it's the story about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like how the the school like
class president basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like, you know normally the anime troop </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of class president is like you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that they're very like pure hearted, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're very like together,
you know they're very adult </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for their age kind of thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But this particular culture is
also a maid, at a maid cafe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And she gets like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could relate to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so basically it's like
a complete opposite, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so basically she gets found out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by this like fucking honk
of a dude called Usui, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> who like all the girls fucking love. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so it's this like special relationship </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where he's trying to hide the fact that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she's not actually just like altogether </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like me time personality and
she fucking hates Usui for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> But of course, with how
every show Jo Manga goes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> she's like, actually this
guy (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I might like this guy and
then Usui is also like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know I kind started
off you know just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just teasing her, but she's kind of hot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was a guy character
I liked what that show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where the characters whole
thing is that he's perfect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he's a student? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sakamoto. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking loved that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I fucking love Sakamoto. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That anime was soo good
(Joey laughing) and soo funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I did not go like, that was an anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that I heard was decent, and I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't expect to love that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sakamoto
- It's so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you haven't seen
Sakamoto it's basically like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole premise is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy is just the perfect human being. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is just the perfect guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And everyone in the school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is trying to like fuck with him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he somehow always manages
to flip it (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Like there was one time where they needed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like make a fire in a room. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So he literally started
doing like back and forward. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh yeah (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He goes back and forward
like jumping back and forward. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the friction between
his shoes starts a fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the friction starts a fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, what? (Joey
laughing and clapping) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I love this, I love this
man, I want fuck him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I loved him so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I was that cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sakamoto like I'll be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't like it that much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? It was so fun.
- Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you don't like it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's because, Sakamoto
it's so pretty much like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every problem I have
with most comedy anime, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is in Sakamoto, which is, I
like the first two episodes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I'm like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or is it the joke too repetitive? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - They kind of doing the
same joke over and over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Became funnier every time
for me, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I knew it was coming, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was always funny when
it got, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, you knew like
whatever situation it was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like you knew. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was going to come out on top. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's going to solve it, but
it's the excitement of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how we see.
- How, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the absurdity of how he
was gonna overcome it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love show that because it
completely defies expectations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of like, he's probably gonna do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then they just completely
flipped and be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like I didn't and
there was no point in my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I thought he was gonna friction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> both the floor into a fire
to save all the students. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I didn't see that coming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanna to work out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so fun, that's like, I
love the comedy anime like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That'll just like, not
trying too hard, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's really weird, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I've had the hardest
time getting into comedy anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Comedy anime are normally
the worst type of anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There are few comedy anime that I enjoy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I put most of them
in the same category </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as like Sakamoto where
it's funny to me like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like one or two episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I get bored very quickly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if they're just kind of
doing the same thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I always need to, like
I always need to be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they always need to be doing
something different for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about something like Nichijou. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait what's a Nichijou </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and also what do you think is
like the best comedy anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh that's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In my opinion it's Nichijou. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Super hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nichijou?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like off the top of my head, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably the hottest I've ever laughed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at a comedy anime was probably Golden Boy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you remember that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that was most of the. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's an old one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a really old one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's the only like
a six episode over you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'd never got the chance
to get bored over there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it is one of the
best dubs I've ever heard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially when it comes to a comedy anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you must've seen the meme </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like of the one clip where it's
the guy doing the swimming. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (mumbles) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the one clip that
gets shared out Golden Boy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And if you're gonna, if
you laughed at that clip, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please watch Golden Boy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's like every
point of Golden Boy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like is just as good as that clip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was just, a one clip that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if that would sell you on that show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can easily re-watch that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Konosuba was also way funnier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> than I thought it was going to be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Konosuba is good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Konosuba I've I really enjoy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in the same way I enjoy like
Always Sunny in Philadelphia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a bunch of awful
people doing all the things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This anime has awful as Always Sunny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Always Sunny it's like my
favorite fucking comedy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love it so much, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The corniness of a movie
as well the surprise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> What's really funny.
- I haven't watched that yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but it was also really weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it was really funny, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> he had no one in the
cinema sloppy (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Japanese cinemas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I felt really
bad laughing out loud. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you ever wish that was
more like, I guess Western Humor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in comedy and cause a lot
of it does kind of feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love this very anime as comedy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's very like some very slapstick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What would classify those
as like Western comedy, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the question
- I think where... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Biggest slapstick as
well it's any western. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't necessarily
think the Japanese humor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is as slapstick as we like to point out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think there's a YouTube video on this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like, well there's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean there's a lot of
TV shows in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where like the whole
comedy is like game shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with that like language, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> With the
- Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like (mumbles) show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a bunch of
other stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I feel like, at least in Western, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> we're like really fucking
brutal with our comedy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like you watch something like Always Sunny </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like (laughs) I couldn't imagine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything like that coming out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Family Guy in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird though 'cause
you have the game shows here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> which go above and beyond what
we would think is acceptable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then when for some reason comedy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like they don't really
joke about that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- Right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a lot of wordplay in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like Japanese
companies a lot of wordplay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of wordplay
right? But they have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the show like fucking Orgasm Wars in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's basically show about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if a dude can make another dude cum. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the whole premise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whole premise, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He recently did a video on it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but basically the most famous
one was there was this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was versus this flipped
super professional Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like male porn star, who can like he says </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I can control when I cum basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So he's always right,
it's a 40 minutes shoot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> all right I'll cum in the middle of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can cum in command. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, basically, he was
like, I'm a cum in command. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which means that if
you tell me not to cum, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll never cum. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then he had to verse this guy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Verse? (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It wasn't verses like he
basically had to verse this guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> He was a bartender in Shinjuku Ni-chome, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like the gay
district of Shinjuku, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's like considered to be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he says he can make any
man cum (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with his skills, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So basically they put him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they put both of them in a room, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is on TV by the way on National TV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> So they put him in a room
he's inside the male porn star </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like inside of a box
that's completely covered. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the gay guy gets in basically. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you don't see anything,
but they're both miked up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So you can hear everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How does this pass television? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) how? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And of course, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with traditional Japanese television </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like in the corner there's like always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the reaction face (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And this is the bunch of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just fucking losing themselves, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just watching dude suck off a gay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you mean like make
him nuts like immediately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He makes him not in like five minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the funniest part
is like, obviously like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you know watching them male porn star, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like cum on national TV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But then we see guys coming out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and being like (speaking
in foreign language) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's soo fucked up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you hear like the dick sucking sound? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, it's on
YouTube as well, mind you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If you look it up, I
guarantee it's on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's got crazy that's
like totally acceptable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then like that human doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or maybe not even like it's not allowed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they don't really find that funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no they find it funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah okay.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that was one of the most
like legendary pieces on TV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You find that funny, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but then why would you
reckon that something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Sunny would be directing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that would be funny to Japanese people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you watched Sunny? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I've seen a bit of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They probably think, man,
these people are really rude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what's so funny about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know cause like the reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've really enjoyed
konosuba over something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like say Sakamoto is
that Konosuba was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way more character-based comedy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I very much like enjoy
character-based comedy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sakamoto it's just like Mr Bean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry to cut you off but. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, that's like the perfect analogy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where a lot of comedy anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the perfect Bean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love the comedy anime
I see it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> hey, there's this one joke and it's funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first few times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> let's see how far we can stretch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But eventually, I'm gonna get bored. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Whereas with a lot of like, you
know, sitcoms and everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that, you know, it's a
lot of character-based comedy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where you know, some of the
best moments are seeing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how knowing the characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and seeing how they
interact with each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, that's what
the comedy builds off of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You talked about Nichijou, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't actually seen Nichijou yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You haven't seen Nichijou? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I haven't, it's been like the one anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the one common anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know you've, do you love Sakamoto? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've fuck love Nichijou. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause Nichijou is that one comedy anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where every joke is expectation defining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause one thing I
will say about Nichijou </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that it doesn't seem like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not a character-based comedy as it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every clip I've seen
looks like funny as far. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the thing that sells him on like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what makes me really want
to watch Nichijou is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every clip I've seen is vastly different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and vastly like they
have an original approach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a joke every time
whether it be like animation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the punchline or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So I would probably really
enjoy Nichijou as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Nichijou is interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I feel it's kind of half, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like halfway between
Sakamoto and Konosuba, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> in the sense that it's a lot like Sakamoto </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where like all the jokes are very, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, expectation
defining and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But as you're watching these
like short clips of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's basically
just a bunch of short jokes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> put into one episode essentially. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But the way that they do it,
the way that it's written, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that like each characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like development is you know,
very physically defined. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So by the end of like the 20
something episodes in Nichijou, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know exactly what
these characters like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> So there is character development </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and character comedy within it as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which I think is what
makes it especially funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where like the more episodes you watch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the more you start to understand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, this character is like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this character is like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I can expect some
kind of joke like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then the writing's
like, no fuck all of that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you thought you were gonna expect, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're gonna give you something
completely different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's what makes it so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And of course it's Kyoto Animation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, you know-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've been meaning to
watch it like forever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've seen the dead scene, the dead scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in so many times every
time I fucking lose money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like there are so many
layers to that one scene. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It just makes me want to watch Nichijou. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And especially after, when
I helped your film the video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with the interview, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the one of the main group's actress. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, Honda Mariko, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and she was super chill and nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, she was the voice of Yugo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I felt bad cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish I could appreciate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Being in front of you more but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was crazy because all regular voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is literally Yugo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like I'm talking to Yugo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah, it's fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean I'm sure people can agree </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's the good thing
about Nichijou, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that like unlike Konosuba
where you kind of have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to like understand the
story and the characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's very, I feel it's really hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like watch a Konosuba
scene out of context </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and still be fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah I would agree with you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it's the characters
that have been built up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, you need to
understand the characters, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but Nichijou somehow
there is characters in it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they've somehow established the joke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where you can just watch a
clip completely out of context </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and still fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because okay, like to
counter off that point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the other show that I can think of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where I got kind of bored
quite fast was a Pop Team Epic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately, sorry Joey,
nothing to do with you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no it's okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I heard you on the Ratio
Joey (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I turned that shit off immediately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It wasn't funny, try again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like Pop Team Epic was great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> until I realized that not every. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no there not every clip was funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And like, and then I
realized that the optimal way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to watch Pop Team Epic was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to watch like the YouTube compilations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I realized that, hey,
I could spend 10 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you know, 20 minutes if
you wanna watch both versions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or I could spend like
five, three to five minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just watching the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hated how I played twice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that shit was weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was okay for one episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I was like, oh, we're doing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh we're doing it every episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I can, you know,
having been in the anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can confidently say a
lot of it wasn't funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Both laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of was just really
stupid in my opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was very like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Except the episode I was in
that was fun (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's was a banger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's was in the top 10
anime episodes of all time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was like way too much
Ha Ha XD internet humor, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like insulate Meme Humor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> A lot of the times I would
say the one comedy anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I'd say pulled that off well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but this is going back way back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if you guys
have heard of this anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> called Cromartie High School. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like a really, really old anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that kind of predicted a lot
of internet and Meme Humor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way before way before
this was like prevalent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like our culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember the one clip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's made me watch the
entire thing was it was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember when it came out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was like early 2000, it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 2002 or something.
- Something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was like
parodying internet trolls </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like the early 2000s
something like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is fucking brilliant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so ahead of his time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if it has
aged badly or not badly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't really watched it in a while, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that was also something where the dub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was fucking brilliant as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember reading the
Manga at a friend's place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've never laughed
so hard reading a Manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's an anime that was funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> purely because it was just
so fucking awful and like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean there's a lot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's my entire career </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just watching bad anime and laughing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I watched King's Gamefor the first time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking lost it, I couldn't
stop laughing as shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no King's Game was bad
and then there was the dub. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Was just made it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't watch the dub, is it bad? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I felt so bad cause it
was obvious that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know it wasn't on their priority. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It was rough dude, it was rough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a really shame as well
because like when I've heard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that the King's Game anime,
I was like fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh man, I kind
like the Manga though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like really a shame </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that the anime just like
completely fucked it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't remember
trying watch two episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where I was like, I've seen
enough, I'm just satisfied. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I was just like fucked
dude, this is fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - A thing to see that burst out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or burst a laughing out was
I think there was a challenge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where the guy had to sleep with the girl </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's the girl is like
the main guy's girlfriend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or crush I can't remember what it was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but so it's his best friend
who has to sleep with this girl </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> who is the main characters girlfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna say girlfriend now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so he doesn't wanna do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he doesn't want to betrays bro like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the main character is
trying to fucking argue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with this guy to sleep
with his girlfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so he refuses, so what
he does, this his solution </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is to fucking deck the guy in
the until he turn conscious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the guy he tells
who is girlfriend in the dub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just do it while
he's unconscious, please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is soo bad, my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you sharing any anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You think of the top rack? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, my God, I mean
I've been meaning to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make a series on my channel
where I'd do exactly that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's take the worst
anime and I just love that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I don't know a lot of the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the most horrible
ones are like obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the ones that no ones of fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] True, true, true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So like, I don't know,
what's the famous one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like Skelter Heaven is a famous one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Mass Destruction is a famous one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have seen any of those? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have seen any of those? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I still haven't seen Mass Destruction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mass Destruction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Skelter Heaven sounds
familiar, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Skelter, it's
like one of the worst </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> written anime basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Eiken's another worse written anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no Eiken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I Fucking Eiken is so bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God.
- I love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah I mean fucking
some videos on them all, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but like those ones make sense, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's like, of
course no one knows them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're fucking horrible, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'm trying to think like
what's like a well known anime? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like horrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's cause it's well
known because it's bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like the only one I can think of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is this anime called Garzey's Wing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is I would say it's
less that's less famous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and more infamous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd say like the most other infamous one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is probably the Ghost Stories dub maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean if we're gonna
bring up Ghost Stories. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We might as well talk about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay Ghost Stories dog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fucking legendary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - My favorite fucking dog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll never gonna get
anything like that ever again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So we never will because do you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the story behind how that stuff? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, I know, a lot about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't you explain it
for people who don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically Ghost Stories is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay what is the actual
plot of the show? (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kids go into an
abandoned school building, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> find ghosts trying resolve. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't just their school
building, it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there just ghosts and they have to use. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no there is talking abandoned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> side of the building, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the main building
and then there's the abandoned. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who the fuck freaking pays attention? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I paid attention (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - That they basically
have to get rid of ghosts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically it's the story doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What matters is the dub, as
it's considered one of the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or the best worst dub of all time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or the worst best dub of all time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's weird 'cause online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's seems to be like people can't agree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's like good or bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I can't understand how. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the room of anime basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So basically what
happened is this was a show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that sold so poorly when aired in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that when they sold the licenses, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just basically told the licenses, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> do whatever you want with
this show to make it sell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like we don't care, you have all creative, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you have all creative control. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so basically they just
chip posted in the dub. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's often like seen as the
very first Abridged Series </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's basically what happens </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if a bunch of official doubles
just basically fanned up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and originally show and fuck about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's one of the
most infamous like dubs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has ever been released. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't like, the one the
puppet kills me every time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> he's like the little, the younger Brother, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and his entire lifetime,
he's just going, yay, yay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like his mouth moving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But the dog was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna make you cry in every line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is a really good video
about it by a cartoon type. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember if it
did sell badly or not? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know that's the common thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I swear there was some point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where that actually wasn't
the case and it did do well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember exactly
the story, but again, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Cartoon Ciphers are really great </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like 30 minute video about this whole dub. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They spoke to top sources,
it's really good video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just a really unique dub and also, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because of how they recorded it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normally when you record anime, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whoever goes in first is
like the first to record. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So basically they all
wanted they go in first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so they could like start the improv scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Hosts] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - So everyone to play off of went first. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So they were all trying to get in first, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was just interesting because
when you're watching it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you know that you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wonder who started.
- This scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because even if they spoke first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't mean they were the
one who recorded first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's fun to try and figure out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wonder who fuck started
the shit joke basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's just such a fun dub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and if you, I just watched it all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah I've seen it all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I've seen it all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's so fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I really wish that we
could get something again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but we're never gonna get anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, it's.
- Different times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's different times now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure some of the jokes
that was ended up probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> would not be able to have
like we couldn't get away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with in this day and age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh God, no. God, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's just such like a
timestamp for that time period. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just basically all improv as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is kind of funny how some, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like some of the jokes
I thought were very good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the fact that it
wasn't scripted at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was just all improv,
I'm just like man this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I still think it's funny to this day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even though it might be slightly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know not politically correct. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's definitely not politically correct. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like the Robot scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was so sad that I would
never hear that voice again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> His laugh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> his funny little requests. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Touch me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - His reprimands. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Touch me harder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Both laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's wait, what was the joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about that rabbit were like
it's deadly is so something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it was like the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't get with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not because you're a rabbit
it's because you're black. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you remember that one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - (both laughing) Is
that a joke? Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah it's a joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then the rabbit,
like in the flashback, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the rabbit is like
talking in the flashback. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like touch me harder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, you'd never get away with that now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think there's also back then,
like there was money in it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but the money levels scale
is like very different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think a lot of the
dubbing is focused more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the big shows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But aside from dubs like what is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> universally considered like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this show is just kind of sucks
and it's just not very good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It could be objective really bad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like we can be talking like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is gonna be like
hot takes though now like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Is now watch Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is all about.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't decide if the reason
I thought Higurashi was shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because I watched it didn't dub. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's definitely the
reason why we share. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I thought the show kind of sucked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after like episode two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, wow, this is
really fucking boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it like that normally? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it boring after episode two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or is that because of the dub? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No it's really picks up like
near the end, in my opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And again, this is
when I watched Higurashi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I first started watching animation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this is nearly like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also you've been tainted by the dub. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we talked about the dub
the other day very briefly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It will say I've just
recently watched Higurashi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the first time and
I watched it dubbed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was a hilarious
watch at times because. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's bad, bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Higurashi dub is really
bad and it's not like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not the kind of bad where it's awful, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that he can laugh at. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just, there's one good voice, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess, I think.
- Yes, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And everyone else has just pretty bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which character is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's Shion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What color is her hair?
That's how I remember (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Hosts] Green. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - She is one that did the screaming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the screaming, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember that was pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've seen the dub scene where she like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> does the maniacal screaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, and I looked at
that clip and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the dub must be all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is lot of people who
when the new show was announced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> were like I hope you'll
bringing back the old cast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, I hope they
don't it remember that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing)
Why would you want? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that meant the Japanese cast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They dubbed it well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People are saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they saw the Japanese one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they wanted to bring it back.
- Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was announced they
wanted to bring it back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like, because
there's an argument to be made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like, the actors
are probably better now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the stuff it's also like (hissing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah sometimes they just recasting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get a new slate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, if they are going to bring back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the original cast please,
like have a real auditioning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, (Joey laughing) like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please like make them audition </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because, you know the quality of dubbing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is I'd say a lot better now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] It's much better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Compared to back then
there were definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some very, very good dubs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was definitely
a much larger spectrum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> than you get now, I mean (both laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of the dubs that
came out after Cowboy Bebop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like, this came at the
same time, oh okay, oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when, back in the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when it was like every
doubles like mediocre to shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there was Cowboy Bebop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And everyone just pointed a Cowboy Bebop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as the golden child to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> not all dubs are bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We got Cowboy Bebop. (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was like the DiCaprio
and then (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's well even
people who like I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Brice Patin, I don't know if this is true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was told this it's a lot of the actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> even though they were the voice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there was no problem with
the voice and it's great, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they still have to audition
again for season two, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just to make sure they still there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just to make sure they still got it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just to make sure-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think, I heard that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I'm happy to be corrected on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's what I was told. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah I mean, I thought, I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it might've been because
I watched the dub as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but I just didn't care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was kind of shit right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you do that
to yourself though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay this is back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, I don't know your
100% did not have this face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course not (all laughing) but, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I first got into anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I only watched up
because I came from like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No that's understandable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, I was like, I'm not used to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I rarely, I only do it once
every while for a foreign film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that everyone says is like amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I have to watch them, I have
to watch them talk French, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fine you know, I don't like doing that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) get excited. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But you know for a very
long time I watched only dub </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the show happened to be
one of the top rated shows </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I watched the dub, but it was shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I just moved on with my life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And then obviously later on down the line, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a show comes out that you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really wanna watch the
show it's available in sub, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you make an exception </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then suddenly everything
becomes the exception </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you start watching only sub. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's kinda I think a lot of
anime fans go through that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where they wanna watch dub if possible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I kind of know 'cause
I'm like you'll come around. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You will 'cause there'll be
that one show that's coming out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> They'll be like, all right,
Demon Slayer episode 19. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone said it was
hype, yes I'm watching. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now I whenever I get the chance, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I watched Dubbed all
the time because this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's --
- Come full circle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is a chance where I can watch dub, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like a lot less than
just me watching sub. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So if it's probably, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if it's on Netflix or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm probably gonna wait for the dub </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I did for the Great Pretender. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I was like I knew I
could watch it on Netflix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japanese with subtitles, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I wanted to wait for it to be dubbed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I could enjoy it in a different time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could not express my
disappointment in the dub. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> When they dubbed it like
multilingual to begin with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when they speak in Japanese,
they speak in Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and when they speaking English,
they were speaking English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Only for the first 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they just cut, they
put a note on screen saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right back to normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they did that in the Subla </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well.
- Yeah, as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just because I guess, because in the sub </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the first 10 minutes, it
was the most God awful English, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've ever heard.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, thank God it's a Japanese. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - The French guy was okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The French guy was fine but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Japanese guy sounded like I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's the thing right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Japanese guy was
like, I've done Duolingo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what it sounded like.
- He sounded pretty bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But also (laughing)
like what have you said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people speak English here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't mind it because when
I heard the Japanese people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> speak broken English, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, that sounds right, yeah cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can you enjoy the entire
series as much hearing that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would not be able to enjoy the series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would not be able
to like immerse myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a difference between like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't give it's almost more immersive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that he's speaking to me in
broken (laughing) English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it's possibly too
immersive (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Just like I can't imagine like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't want that kind of immersion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't imagine him being like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Anime.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't imagine like a top play like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The French guy was so good
though he had a French accent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The first guy was good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I can't imagine like a class A actor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like scamming all these people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> with that like broken
English you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just.
- Give me all your money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's like sometimes in you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you watch a Hollywood movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> though they might have like not a main, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like a side character
is pretty prominent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who could speaks broken
English and that's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't like it though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why aren't you like it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause it's broken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they're trying their
best to learn English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But, they're not like, they
never like the main character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or the main focus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess, I don't know
there was something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was really like
refreshing about hearing a guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with a Japanese accent,
who clearly was Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> speak fluent like Japanese
then go to English. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even though, I guess they
were speaking mainly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because if you have, if
you gonna have the show that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they speak mainly English, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then why not just re-dub it so it's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's fully English. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm sure there
was actors out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who sounded Japanese, but were
like native quality English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that could have been Ken Watanabe, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Someone are like Ken Watanabe's level </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely would've worked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love the French guy though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love the fucking fake French. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - If we could get that
level of, what's the word, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm looking for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Multi
- Multilingual. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Multilingual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fluency, I don't know.
- Multilingual fluency. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's term (both laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the term that we
definitely didn't just coin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know there's a term for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just joined out.
- I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I have no fucking, don't look at me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Multilingual fluency. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I get what you mean but don't worry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I get what you're saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you know, like if
you know like Hollywood films, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you always expect when
someone's from that country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that they come from that
country and like, yeah okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the budget is not even
in the same ballpark. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think it's doable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would actually wouldn't have minded </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The Grip Tender with the
broken English the whole time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean it there is a
level of broken English </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would find except for
one that was not like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I would just be like
laughing half the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's so you know,
I love Ken Watanabe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I don't think I'd be
able to watch an entire movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where 90% Ken Watanabe talking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could his English is amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ken's English I feel it's good enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's good, but like even then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like cutting close with me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like the English in Great Pretender </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> was like no way near that level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess yeah, I'm sure
there's actors out there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese who living LA, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who could have like probably have done it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But did they have the budget for it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, what's wrong with anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just felt like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this was the perfect show to
really try and pull that off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Just kind of disappointed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also I think it's because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to most Japanese audiences
or watching Great Pretender </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that level of broken English is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> damn this boy can speak English. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Wow, it's basically fluent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure Japanese side would have also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like to have maybe heard
the same thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would the English people
trying to speak the Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sounding somewhat competent,
I don't know, amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, maybe I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there might've been like a
slight like racism problem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> though involved in that right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even though it's really not racism, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you know people always
throw that out right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Think, like or they
speaking in a funny accent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> must be racist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I feel like the rules
do work a bit differently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> from like live action film to you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dubbed you know and voice
acting and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the expectation
isn't that you can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like a multilingual cast it's that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like one spoken language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we should speak
that one spoken language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything else is
like it can be possible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess like yeah when you watch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's a movie with
like multiple languages. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess because if it
has multiple languages, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you wouldn't follow right?
- Inglourious Basterds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess yeah you wouldn't
need a dub right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I guess that makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean in Inglorious bastards, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they you know they put subtitles, I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when they speak different languages? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hard coded on the movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, in movie, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know, ,cause I
watched a movie recently </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was about like World War II. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Also really fucking awkward
being the only white guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in like a World War II movie
about like the Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like destroyed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just sitting there
and like my seat like this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like I'm American. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just waving the flags. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like you know, like
when the, if I can like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there was like the planes
were being bombed and shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, do I like feel happy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that the Japanese go like whooped here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are they happy, are they
like, damn those Americans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They got us, it was weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know like what
the vibe is in the cinema. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (All laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Considering have we talked
about that time we watched, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what's that film? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fukushima </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - 50
- Fukushima 50. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So that we. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Holy Joey wasn't there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wasn't there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, is it called Fukushima 50? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Fukushima 50. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So there was this film
that was made in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about the whole Fukushima tragedy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's like how to couch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And it's like how to couch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we got invited to like
a private screening of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So we got an early copy of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - To give our thoughts to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you know, the whole
film, you know it's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ken Watanabe is in it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's fucking amazing.
- Ken Watanabe is in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I've got you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's you know, I'd rate
it a good like six out of 10, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was some really good moments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there were some
really boring moments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there were these moments in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they focused on
these American characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and the like the American military, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who wanted to you know
he wanted to help Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And for one, some of them
weren't even American. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There was this like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're like South Africans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there is one African dude in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They were like South African </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in this American military boardroom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he sounded didn't even
try to fucking hide it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> He sounded like such a fix (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's not a like a
light accent South Africa, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really fucking for long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just so
confusing and yeah, go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't remember the exact line, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but there was this one, do
you remember the exact line? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do, I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay do you wanna
explain the exact line? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm actually paraphrasing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was roughly something like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So there okay to explain the scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before he says the line. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was so obviously the
Fukushima emergency was happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and the Americans were like
discussing how to help, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> help the Japanese and how to provide aid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - All these scenes were shot like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so the Japanese scenes
were shot like perfect, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the cinematography was on point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it cut to like
a fucking sit-com quality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking camera cuts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> He looked really shit and then
the act is opened their mouth </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like oh fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And imagine a script right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Of how Japanese people think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that American people talk about the war. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the only way I can
describe how the Americans spoke, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was like, the
one line was like, when it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like it blew up, actually to
the Americans they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> men, you think they would have learned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how to handle nuclear
technology after we nuked them? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like the line and
we all looked at each other, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like you just say that, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like we were in like this
like private screening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We looked around, it was
me, Connor, Sydney and Malin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then every like just
Japanese businessmen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the Japanese businessmen
were like fully immersed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were quiet and we're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah this is not American speak. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was looking around
a Connor, Sydney and Malin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and we were just all like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like Joey's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck did we just here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) Is this okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like what? They
can't say that, can they? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just so bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was just so bad, so bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then just like to imagine the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking South African guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and be like, I agree with
everyone in this room right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - South African guys said it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's just every time it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> please don't cut to the Americans, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> please don't cut to the America </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> don't cuts the fucking American </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was just like an 80 SIMCOM, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's already fucking right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they had like this
flashback scene as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with this one character,
there's one American general </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who had no play in the plot or whatever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had zero screen time and
then they just randomly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cuts to a flashback of him in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, why is this in the film? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then like towards the end, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just the shot of
like the Americans coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and giving water bottles to them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like, all right sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll take a bottle of heavy in hell I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just been nuked, but
thanks for the water bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - This will really save
us, thanks America. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like if that line was
in an American film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God.
- The fucking shit storm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It would start. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's the thing
bro, it's okay 'cause it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> written like, I assume, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it was written by a Japanese and outsource </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like an American company on a budget, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm fucking guessing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - American like outsourcing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was like we have to translate this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are we lancing, is this is right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was fine, I just
try not to go to films </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where Japanese the bad guys,
I've kind of learned my lesson. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's brutal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I thought I
was gonna watch Tenant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it turned out it was just a war movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I genuinely got the wrong
tickets (laughs) the wrong thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I paid for the wrong tickets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna watch Tenant, I did watch Tenant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really good by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Watch it, yeah it's basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna watch that as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like Inception, but
more mind fuck I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyway, what we talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We talking bad anime
and we go on another turn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why do they talk about the cinema? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't fucking know about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone can scroll back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We can't do that though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, everyone's gonna
be like, it's so obvious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what you're
talking about please everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Higurashi right? Or some shit.
- That's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We were talking about Higurashi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How you guys willingly... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The actors pretending-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I would like, I'm going to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> the remake of Higurashi in Japanese. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause the reason I watched in Japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was 'cause like you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna re-watch in Japanese
anyway, it's on Netflix, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I might as well watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought he was an okay time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly I was paying half
attention half the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] You know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I was fucking
doing arc nights roles, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't fucking remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - (Joey laughing) Keeping
his priorities straight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I watched an episode of Anohana again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of thought of shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've watched all of Anohana, and I agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was looking at you to be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> don't you dare I finish the sentence sir, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> don't drop the eSports </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was kind of shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I watched Anohana like three years ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I fucking bawled my
eyes out, great time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I watched to the episode
one again I'm like, wow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I stuck at this episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nothing happens in episode one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's why shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Episode one was by far the
worst episode of Anohana. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The episode one of Anohana of
almost put me off of Anohana. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That makes it kind of shit bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I thought when it first started, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought he was like some
Lolly fan service Baits. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember seeing
where men must sit on his lap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, (Joey laughing)
here we fucking go again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - The guy is like fuck, here we go again. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was just like, another
Lolly bait Fan Service show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I think it was
like halfway through episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like there all like the
end of episode two or three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I actually got emotionally invested. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember episode one
was like pretty bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you think if Anohana came out today, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it would be given the same level
of respect that it's given? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think you could hold to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think so because at the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that Anohana came out,
there were very few shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that went in that direction.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like and especially with
like how short the show was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it managed to do
something in 12 episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that a lot of anime struggled
to do in late 20 plots. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's right they were like kind anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Now if you go watch it
back, I don't think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, to be fair that you
only watched episode one, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I didn't watch it all again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched just episode one again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well then that's probably
why you thought it shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you watched the worst episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But after I watched it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like how the did I make it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to episode two after I watched
this? 'Cause it was shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but that's the
same as like every person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who watches like the first
episode of Steins Gate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like, why would
I continue to watch it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Episode one of Steins Gate
is good, right? I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was a little boring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember thinking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was looking outside half the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't fucking remember anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For some reason with anime like I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why did you start to re-watch it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it was Emirichu, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Emirichu she told me,
she thought it was shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I thought no, it's
good right, it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I went back and rewatched it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but I guarantee Emily also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only watched episode one
and was like, it's shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, she watched all of that, she said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but she watched it recently.
- Oh, well then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Common and defend yourself, Emily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've watched Anohana and
felt like, four times I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Four times?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've only rewatched it
once and I thought it was so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'd have flying cars by now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> people stop rewatching
anime this many times, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are you fucking kidding? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Four times why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I remember I think Anahona </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was the very first anime
that got me to cry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember back and
forth before I watched Anahona, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like stone-faced, I
can never cry during anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And she like this watching. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I ain't no bitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm a real man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and then like a bitch the
first time I watched Anahona. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And like after I watch Anahona, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was so fucking long before
I could find like other shows </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that I could, you know
bring a tear to my eye. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I tried watching Clannad, that
just didn't fucking happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean it's so easy to make me cry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I feel like just the right beeps </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and boops will make me cry right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You find one good dub
person and you're like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I love this beeps and boops.
- You're soo beautiful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, so like the reason I
re-watched it so many times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was whenever I felt like I
just need a good cry right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But so I would just put
on Anahona just to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> get just get those emotions out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It takes you that much to get a cry out? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Before I can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you not just like do
it just like on command? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, if I'm fit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't know I put that
there, Malin is like what? So. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've got to prepare myself,
that's how I was spilling tears. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's how I do it on Quebec. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> No, so if I feel like I need to cry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like as you say you feel
like you need to cry, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need that push, I need
to like listen to that song </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or I watch the anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I pretty much replicate
what that guy did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the best cry ever video of like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (mimicking crying) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I basically like just
sit there and I'm like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (mimicking crying) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then once you get it started, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it like goes you know for like 30 seconds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But, does that feel
the same as like normal? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can watch a fucking KFC
commercial and start crying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If I'm in the right mood, honestly yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it's like an emotional soundtrack to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like I could get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause the thing is right it's like Wank. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just a different type of Wank, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And my mind I'm like they both feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the exact same when you've done it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when you cry, it feels
like a relief, when you wank. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you ever cry wanked? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't dare try to mix the two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know how easy this is for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He hasn't read metamorphosis. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Read more metamorphosis
you'll know the definition </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of a cry wank. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you do that cry without urge, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you not feel like when you
stop crying you're like, ah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No that's why we put
it on because before that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I just couldn't cry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How's the whole process
take to make you cry? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> How many episodes do you wanna
watch for you start crying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lemme skip to the right path. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so if we go beyond just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> re-watching the entire thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes I would just like,
if I needed a quick cry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if I needed like a five minute wank </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or whatever I'm like a cry WanK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would just put on the
final episode, I'd be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, wait you just said cry wanked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to the ending of Anahona. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no (Joey and Connor hamming) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Using the same analogy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I needed that, like quick set, like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Skip the blow job right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Go right to penetration. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, just straight into tears, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you go to like the fucking end of Anahona. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If I needed like the
full buildup or anything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> if I had like a whole day to waste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was just fell If I just
felt emotional the entire day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I just had a shit day and
I just needed to cry it out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I just re-watch Anahona. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was about to say like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had kind of imagine
someone being like fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to cry or I tell
time to invest six hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into this year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just feel like you
say no or something like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> How did you start crying man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I completely like relate to the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I need to cry, then
like a good song will do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that to me instantly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I know, I have like a list, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> immediately I'm just saying, I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> if I put this song on.
- Men need to cry more. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know the exact timestamp </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> as to where the tears will start coming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Men should start, men should cry more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like men should cry more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like once I discovered Anahona, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I was on a fucking mission
to find my next anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that could make cry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - That next time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was because I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've always had like trouble crying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or show my emotion like
publicly or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> For some reason like watching, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the saddest thing could
happen to me IRL right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't cry, I don't
know why like for example, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like I fucking love my grandmother, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I thought this entire time when I, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when she passed away
and I went to her funeral, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I couldn't shed some tears. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I for some reason I just
couldn't shed tears, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though I knew I cared about her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I loved her as like family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like one of the person I like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's a thing like,
you don't have to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> show that emotion,
express it like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outside to feel it right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But for some reason, watching
a good scene in an anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or watching that one anime
that just brings it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That just gets it out full me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's feels like
it feel safe at home, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you feel like, all right,
I can be vulnerable, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can do this here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can you cry in front
of other people though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I'm in a movie with someone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't matter who it is, if
it's fucking sad, I'll be like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you one of those
people who like watches </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like something really emotional on a plane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can cry on a plane? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can cry on a plane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I have cried
on the plane (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like fucking you checking out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I'm definitely one
of those people who are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if I watch, 'cause I watch Maki on a plane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I fucking cry like basically on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but I had to like really just
strain my eyes and be like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I cannot show weakness to
the person sit next to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's a
subconscious thing for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause if there's other people around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there are sometimes
that I want to cry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to cry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just sometimes when
there's someone else there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just lose like froze for a split second, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I lose the immersion and then I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ah, I got to build up
myself like the tears, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to build up again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's crying hard for me, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I value it whenever
something does make me cry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> which is why I've really
value for example your name. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because that was the only time
I've ever cried in a cinema </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with other people around me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But that was less because
it was sad and more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's like,
there's just so many emotions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now, this is beautiful, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughing) I just
have to let it out somehow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll go on, I was on a train </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was on the Yamanote
Line or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was watching a video
and it's actually about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they in Japan, they have
like cinemas to make men cry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I was watching
this video about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they make basically, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just Cry Porn to a bunch
of Japanese businessman. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was kinda like a game
show almost in this video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it was like, this one
guy was just refusing to cry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then right at the final
clip like the sixth one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like a fucking tear as he's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) soo funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah as they were describing like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> this woman was describing
what was in the clips, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did I show you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It just hurt describing it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I was fucking like tearing
up on the Yamanote Line, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so fucking sad 'cause
it was something like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> there was so like a kid's mom passes away </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he's helping with his dad only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he is like is so fucking sad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Holy fuck, I don't want
to go through that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, man it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know there's nothing wrong
with like crying in public. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know this is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is not like full on, I'm
just like shedding you tears. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but even like shedding tears, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like I have like I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I have some kind of restriction with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's just a
subconscious mental block. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know 'cause I have
exactly the same thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I wish I could like bring
out my emotions more easily, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but because it takes me
so many fucking steps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to get to that point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know that's why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't give a fuck though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) A lot of things in public. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not about giving a
fuck like I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you give a fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No I'm not like, I'm like in my head, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like cry, cry, cry, cry, cry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No! (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then something my
brain is just like no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> don't do it, don't do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess there is like some it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know just mental block that even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when you know you should
it's like your brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like but don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think it was just
the way I was raised, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So somethings, sometimes you've realize, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> man the way you were, how
you're raised as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is pretty fucking important too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it like affects how your like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> how you subconsciously think
for like the rest of your life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it takes so much more
effort to unlearn something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than to like relearn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is like learned
something for the first time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you ever like catch
yourself doing something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that your parents used to do
to you when you were a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the way they would talk of it like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember like, I
think what was it like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My dad used to have
this really specific way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of making excuses up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I caught myself doing it
one time and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fuck I picked it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that moment where you're
like shit, I am my dad's kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - (all laughing) Fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm becoming. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought I was
superior this whole time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I was just equal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the thing right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like you listened to your dad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all your life.
- You know all the bullshit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that your parents do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You listen to it all your life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then when you get to like
your teens and you hear it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you make fun of them for being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm never gonna be like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then years later you
catch yourself doing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and be like, oh no! (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was the same this entire time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's been a lot of like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Always has been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had to like physically like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and mentally just be like,
don't do this, don't do this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't do this thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I thought they
were like weird things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing bad but like just little quirks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that my parents would do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like certain
ways you say things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where you're just like, this
is the first time me saying it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but for some reason I've heard it before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, you are
like fuck my parents, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they planted the seeds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (All laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah, I mean, Anahona,
I still love it to this day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Made, made, I surely love the word made. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If that's the case, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> what anime would you recommend
to someone to make them cry? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> What's it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Golden Time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is that Golden Time? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that the right name? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Golden Time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I always fucking call it
something different by accident </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like golden week or some shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - To me Golden Time is
in the same categories </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as Anahona for like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a cult though, I
like the cult, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I just found that whole
call awkwardly dumb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I really enjoy how stupid that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't even remember that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't even remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was a part where
she was like brainwashed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> in a cult or some shit
that happened, I think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, I'm basically
a patient in waiting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So I mean I'm probably the wrong person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I definitely didn't get a cry bone a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> from watching Golden Time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is another show that
it's like really good cry upon? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> An anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's the best Cry Porn Anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean anything by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shinkai
- Jun Maeda right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, anything Maeda
Jun, anything Shinkai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not one of those people who knows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay Maeda Jun is like,
Clannad, AngelBeats, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Little busters anything
by Keys studios basically, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like pretty good cry porn.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't find any Angelbeats
as sad as everyone else, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I felt like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I cried because of the angels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was obvious it was
gonna happen though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I felt exactly the same way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was my same problem with Clannad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just less stretched out
where he was so obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to make you cry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was yeah, it's literally just Cry Porn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where you just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was going to cry, he
was crying, aren't you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes just to like make you cry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and make you shed tears. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but I have like an initial, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like my Cry Porn was raw card
the moment I see Maeda Jun, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I know it's like,
I don't even have to watch it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm already prepared, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I just googled Saddest
anime, just Saddest anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Google says, number one, Anohana. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - See Emily? Even Google agrees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Plastic Memories, which is was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Plastic Memories it's okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wish you knew again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was just basically
Kansa with waifu's waiting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like I Want To Eat Your Pancreas. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually I Want To Eat Your
Pancreas fucking brilliant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I Want To Eat Your
Pancreas is a fucking cry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Angel Beats.
- Angel Beats, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Madoka Magica </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Madoka, I didn't cry at
the end of Madoka Magica. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a difference
between sad and bleak. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like Madoka Magica here
is more on the bleak side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Madoka Magica is like grief crying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's Guilty Crown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (Garnt laughing) Guilty Crown? Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I cried because of
how bad the ending was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if that's what they mean by that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was a Stein's actually, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I really liked Guilty
Crown, I would just say it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I like it.
- The ending though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like all of Guilty Crown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what Connor, I'm
absolutely there with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (both laughing) Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the one fucking
time me and Connor agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People need to stop comparing
it to as a Code Geass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Code Geass is in it's its own world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do you compared to that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't compare to Code Geass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I still thought
the ending was amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't the best ending of the world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but man it was a fucking good run. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was entertaining as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was beautiful
- Did you cry though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I probably did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was actually this close to crying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's it wasn't because of the story, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just because of how.
- The music. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The beeps and the boops were soo hype. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay here's the thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing about me in crying is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> music has so much more power
over me (mumbles) does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's if there's a good soundtrack, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like almost always close to crying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, why do you think I cried, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to everything Maeda Jun does? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because he makes the music as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which makes me cry like a bitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, I don't know like I liked it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the Guilty Crown had it's
like emotional moments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and obviously, you know
the soundtrack was good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my cry bone was like a
half child the entire time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like,
- I really liked it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like it was so close. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe it's because I haven't watched it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in four or five years, but
maybe it's Garnt tinted glasses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm looking through an app
and I really enjoying it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really enjoyed it
not in the sense where, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hey I'm gonna recommend
this as a good show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really enjoyed it in the sense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it was just here's
a lot of dub anime tropes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that I enjoy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not gonna, I don't
care if they make any sense </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whether they put these anime tropes in, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but (laughs) it's just like
a lot of good popcorn fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's was great show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's kind of reminds me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember when Darling
In The Franxx first aired, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I called Darling In The
Franxxto guilty crown </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of this generation (Joey
and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I kind of still agree
with myself on that point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> where Darling In The
Franxx got stupid as fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but he was entertainingly stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I mean, the thing about
Darling In The Franxx is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I went through a whole
fucking emotional arc with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because it was the first half I would say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was actually legitimately good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you watch your weekly by the way? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I did watch weekly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I already thought that
Darling In The Franxx </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was a great character drama with MXNet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was super, super
emotionally invested, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in this as a series. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then the fucking space
thing happens and then it went. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - More trigger was like,
let me introduce myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah exactly, and my enjoyment
for Darling In The Franxx </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of just shifted off that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't, I wasn't emotionally
attached to anymore, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it wasn't that same kind of enjoyment, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just the look at all
this happening out of enjoyment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think when you watch a show weekly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think like you're almost more likely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to think it's better than it is, if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like holding your attention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I disagree.
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think watching something
like not having to wait </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just marathoning
something I've enjoyed shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I haven't enjoyed weekly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I've watched a of marathons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I almost find
that when you wait a week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for something that you're
kind of excited for, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you almost like hype yourself up for it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unlike, think that it's
like, how written it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hard for me to say though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because haven't watched an anime weekly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> since like High School. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Been were watching Re:Zero weekly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think maybe there's an aspect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of me that thinks it's better
because the mystery being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like drip fed because of having
to wait a week at a time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right but I think that only works </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's a mystery, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually Re:Zero is that exact show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember kind of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember enjoying it watching it weekly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I kind of only kept up
with it cause it was my job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember re-watching it all at once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after there was no
pressure to like keep up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> little bit of review. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I enjoyed it way more
watching it all at once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and not having to wait weekly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though I knew what was gonna happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's why I haven't
like I've kept up kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with Re:Zero Season Two,
but I watch it in chunks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not completely up to date with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause I wonder, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> cause I watched Attack on
Titan season three, four, two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that the title? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the latest one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I watched that weekly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, the latest one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I don't know if it's because like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's I watched it weekly and
every single week was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh my God, I have to wait
a week, this is so hype. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the best thing ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like in my memory,
season three part two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is fucking like God, God tear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I marathon did and it was still do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's still like that
amazing even if like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or I mean I don't know
how you're feeling about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously like it's
pretty one of the best anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've ever watched if not
like it's like top two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean I binged the
entire thing in a day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so, it's fucking amazing.
- it's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We've already sung the
praises of talking title a ton </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on this podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's one of the few ratios </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like weekly or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just objectively
a fucking great show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know like the experience
I think is just as powerful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Spoiler Alert just for
like one minute here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whenever the video comes up my recommended </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of Levi versus the Beast
Titan, I'm like, I've got time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got time for three more minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of that Spoiler Warning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah lets agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, we somehow got
onto good anime now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> let's go back to that
anime, the worst anime ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know what I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's like a famous,
like what's like a show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like, not universally praised </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like, not like,
it's not like Garzey's Wing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Mass Destruction
where like the only reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why it's known is because it's bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know because, here's the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> if there's a bad anime,
I'm likely not to watch it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or finish it right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because, okay here's the
thing, if something's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as bad as Garzey's Wing or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> then I'm gonna finish it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I still think it's good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it gives me some
kind of entertainment value. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What I don't like the
worst thing an anime can do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> for me is just be boring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's B made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not going to lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got to High School kind
of shit, kind of shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going to say, it's kind of boring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You mean God of Mid-school? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - (Joey laughing) God of Mid-school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I made a tweet
about Rental girlfriend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was like three people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> who were like God of High School </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the best anime of the season. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, what season did you watch it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Watching God of High School
just makes me so disappointed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like the disappointed, because I look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> at some of these fight scenes
and I still think choreography </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and animation wise, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's probably some of
the best fight scenes you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> can find all year so far. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't think of a better anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think we've said like,
it's pretty just disappointing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was so popular. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't know, I've heard
from a lot of Webtunes Readers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that it basically skipped
through everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just gave you the fights. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's not how to do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Exactly, but I mean, it just
gave me the feeling of just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, watching like
a very good fight animation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on like YouTube was something where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have these fight scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it would've worked
better being clipped </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and put onto YouTube with no context </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than it would have been in like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I watched like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I didn't actually watch the anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just saw the clips on
YouTube and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's some cool fight
scenes, but is it enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for me to get invested into the show? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Probably not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I watched like 10 episodes
of Narrotor like last year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I wanted to get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait for season.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like as kids narrator? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like the very.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that was horrible
because, (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, oh my God, even
the story feels like fella. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's why I
never got into Narrator. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, I'm watching
this and I'm 10 episodes in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like nothing has happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> We've like left the village
and we've gone like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've watched more opening and ending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> than I have like show development. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then that annoying show in thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which I think should be
like, it should be illegal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You shouldn't be put
in prison if you do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while you put four minutes
of the previous episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the start of the
episode after the intro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's only six minutes of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you've already seen
and don't need to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 43, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We call that shown in recap syndrome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 14 minutes to the actual episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like seven minutes actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> somehow they find a way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - To last like six of
some One Piece of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah that's I was about to say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how there are still anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only watches of One Piece when that is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was like literally every episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the past six years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause I remember the
last I watched One Piece, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was the Punk Hazard dog. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And literally every
fucking episode was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here's an extended opening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then 10 minutes of filler, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five minutes of actual content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then an extended ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's cause there's only one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They only adapt like one
chapter per episode times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, granted the
chapters are dense as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You compare the chapters
today of One Piece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to like some of the early chapters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like the like
added to like a light novel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into his chart in between these dialogue. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's so small and
it's so concentrated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah I mean it still doesn't add up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to like one entire anime
episode worth of content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my opinion though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah reread the Manga of One Piece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why should I Gigguk? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's too long Gigguk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's it's too fucking big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the worst argument
I've ever heard of anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want it's like, why
you get a degree Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's only four years come on, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Why aren't you doing it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so good for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got degree and it was shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but if enjoyed the degree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay what if there's this
really good thing right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you want it to like end quickly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or do you want it to keep going
on for as long as possible? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause that's One Piece, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you're talking about
it like it's a commitment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're into One Piece.
- It is, it is a commitment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like you can say the
same to my Jojo anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess yeah, but then at
least Jojo this like part. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you can like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah would One Piece there's Arcs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Arcs of different departs though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know man I stopped
at the Punk Cassadaga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I could easily go back to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't feel
comfortable stopping mid Arc. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, but that's thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry between. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't feel comfortable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no but that's why I
ended until the Arc was over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like take a break. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah but I wouldn't feel
comfortable doing that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's the same show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the same characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They're still doing this adventure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not finished. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't just stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't matter because
it's going to get shown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in recap syndrome at the
beginning of the next one anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just, I think the thing is because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's also daunting for the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> if I get into it, it's great
that there's that much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's also terrifying
that this, that much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's the thing
like you're saying it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the pretense of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm probably not going to
enjoy One Piece, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm saying what's worrying is
if I do enjoy, because I'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> going to get anything
done for like five years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to be there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Just fucking reading
about how loofy his arms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> had ripped off by like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I completely get what
you're saying because I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was having this thought experiment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So if I wasn't already into One Piece, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what'd you get into could I convince, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could it could future
me or could like I could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> could I convince an
alternate universe of me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who hasn't seen One Piece
to now get into One Piece? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, that is so difficult, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how I would convince myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get into One Piece. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Our schedule was already pretty rammed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with not reading Manga and
the Manga I do get to read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is very small parts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I wouldn't want to read something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because I don't read
several Mangas at one go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I read one Mongo at a time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I read it all and go onto the next. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't know why my brain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just can't I don't really enjoy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I'm not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm exactly the same as
Connor, when I'm into something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when I'm into something has to
be that I am into something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally lost fucking
two days of doing nothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I caught up to rental a girlfriend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was just like my
obsession for that two days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if your friends, a
girlfriend is like 500 chapters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I would have just lost like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah, no, I dedicated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an entire month just reading bulky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How many chapters of One Piece? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Almost a thousand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but like on the
flip side, on the flip side </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really value that because it's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like part of me is like
part of me of like has, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who is someone who has been an anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Manga fan for so long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of missed the feeling
like you had as a kid where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could just lose an
entire week to just to just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching this anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because is it like, is
it, am I that you guys are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same way? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like so hard for you
to like marathon stuff now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like, especially if
it's like over 12 episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really hard for me, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really hard for me
to marathon something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's why when I'm like
into a show and I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> properly into it and I'm just losing days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really value that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I search for it wherever I can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's so hard for me to find like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if there's like
technically a good show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or a good series, which I can say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, this, this is a good show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt really fucking good like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> when I finally marathon Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in like two days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, I haven't felt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I actually finished a show
that was more than 12 episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I missed the
feeling of just having days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and time passed where you're not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like when you're not like.
- I was discussing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> What, how, why it sucks to be a adult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Damn, I just have like no time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No time to marathon,
like working all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, I will say that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> if you do one that feeling
just get into One Piece. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 1000 chapters doesn't sound that bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I read all of I shields. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There volumes of Jojo
than there is One Piece. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there more chapters of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh I guess there's this tendency more? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I read five through
seven of Jojo in like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think just over a week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah you could easily get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from like the Alabaster
Loc, to like the Mermaid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was like a week
of me sitting in my bed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a cup of tea nonstop just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, if you get into it,
then it won't really matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the problem is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to lose three
weeks of my life minimum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're gonna enjoy the cluster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're gonna remember those
three weeks of your life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and your you're going to look back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have to show for it, go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you'll finally
be able to come jump </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> into a conversation about One
Piece and being like, yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if there was like an X pocket
sheet, like a real life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> X-Box achievement where you
can be like, I've read one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can have like this badge that says </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've read One Piece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like something
about my driving license </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tangible to show for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You have to invest yourself
is what I'm hearing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I guess I don't really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> how much free time do I have? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It kind of varies I guess on the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like some we use YouTube, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So some days I'm walking all day nonstop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Some days I'm sitting
there trying to think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of a video idea and nothing happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just didn't do anything all day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Play the game of league
maybe, I don't know.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> But like if I read something
it's so hard to see that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as like a, I'm not the type
of person who reads casually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, if I read, I need to like focus </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and decide that I'm going to
read and it be a long thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't just be like, yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll read a chapter
for five minutes again. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's people I know
who can pick up a book </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> read two pages and be
like, nice that was good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna go do the rest, I'm like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, that's like,
that's like getting a semi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and being like at a good
wank (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I need like a minimum
of like five chapters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to fully get myself in
in like the reading zone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then once I'm in that zone, I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay don't talk to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like that sense of flow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't understand people
who can like read a book </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and watch a movie at the same time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or like have the TV on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the background. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - On the background, can
you pay attention to it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need complete silence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, that's because like every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd like, Akira story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she comes into, you read
your Manga, like what woman? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, there's
no noise in the room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I need my total peace to read this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's holding like fat lolly acids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> volume one and what this is woman? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't, you see I'm reading literature. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Make it a Manga, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's an oxymoron, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a color book. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - (all laughing) It's a
draw Manga, coloring book. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, boys, I have
a question I want to know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is there any anime out
there that you, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe have a hot take on like
an anatomy that you think is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> either really good anatomy
that you like that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> highly praised and widely
accepted to be amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you think isn't that good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or is there a show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that everyone thinks that
you think is pretty good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jury's already had his with school cars. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I've really
loved the Cabo bebop dub </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but the show itself, I didn't
think it was like that good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna to be honest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I liked it, but I didn't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like the masterpiece worthy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like everyone says, it's like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate that, I can disagree with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - like it's, like the dub.
- Like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've heard Samurai
Champloo a million times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nah, nah, a million times more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was about to say I have
exactly the same opinion </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just with Samurai Champloo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, Samurai Champloo was
a million times better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me, like this, like
I don't know what it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about Samurai Champloo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought the story, the style
and the music was amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the music is amazing
particularly wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like the reasons
why I liked Cowboy Bebop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was one the dub and two,
nothing to do with the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought the story was kind
of like all right, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just, I just feel like Cowboy Bebop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had some really interesting ideas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's kind of like
a couple of people up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is isn't like a long
like it doesn't have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a very long overarching story arc. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's more of these individual ideas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, that's once
an IRB wants to explore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I thought it had
some really good ideas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so did Samurai Champloo but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know something
about Samurai Champloo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just made me feel like the idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is just one is interesting
individual level. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you, can you sit
here and like say to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that Cowboy Bebop deserves
to be like in the top five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as it always is on every single piece? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes.
- Really, top five? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when I see it all time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when I see it, it's like those people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who put Citizen Kane at number one on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like yeah, I know movies,
Citizen Kane's my favorite, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know the movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I is a Rosebud, my favorite quotes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, when I see that
on someone's like top five, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I immediately think they're
like trying too hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be a quick cause to me I don't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of animated like a critical
sense most of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just thought when I watched it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like it's really
cool, tons of style. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just thought the story was kind of mad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, if you get,
if you go into for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a big story, then it's just a show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so what about the
Samurai Champloo story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was good then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, it has been a long
time since I've watched both. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is the same here, same here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I don't know, I remember
just having a ton of fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> every single episode of Samurai Champloo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me the story and like character, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like how much I enjoyed the
story and the characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about Samurai or Champloo,
Cowboy Bebop around equal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was everything else around the show, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like the music, the sound
effects, like the animation stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that made Samurai Champloo
just that much better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did not give a about the
annoying kid on Cowboy bebop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I didn't give
a fuck about Fuu for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what are they trying to do again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Hosts] Finding the Samurai
that smells like sunflowers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the plot doesn't matter an E the show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just liked the
characters Samurai Champloos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I thought, because
we had only three of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like, we got a lot more
time to like flush it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Whereas they just brought
this sidekick character </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and a dog and I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - To be fair, I love Iron though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, he's... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Iron is great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Iron is spike is like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of the coolest anime
characters of all time jet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think Mugen was cooler, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to be honest with you
(Garnt laughing) just saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think Mugen was way cooler than Spike. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think spike is dope </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But if I had to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say which one was cool,
I'd definitely Mugen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Spike can beat Mugen (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Microsoft (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You have a bike able
to survive AIDS though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - My character can beat up your character, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> have you thought about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're going to do swing
your Samurai sword, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Spike and just shoot him then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - (all laughing) Mike, Mike, where's Mike? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know this has been one of those shows, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I do think is great but just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever I see it in top fives, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, you're just shining out of your. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, okay like I have
a very similar opinion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not of cowboy bebop, but just.
- Even galleon? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Akira, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Akira, I think (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you guys get
a shout (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think Akira is Mid as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ah, you're dead to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You are absolutely dead to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, I think it's
one of those things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it came out at the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was a game changer at the time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't think now it
holds up, it's still a game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We watched it several
times trying to find </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what about it, amazing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and every time we want you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like man the animation
still holds up the whole time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, it just, it's just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, it's just
nothing much better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You want to share your thoughts on that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is my last episode of trash. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm leaving after this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't handle it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, Akira to me is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think to this day it still stands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as one of the most unique
cinematic experiences in anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm not just talking.
- You're wrong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I agree with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm not talking about that in terms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of like the flashy
colors and the fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, ooh, it looks pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like I'm not just talking
about it like that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I just, I don't know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I've rewatched the Akira so many times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and every time I've rewatched it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially like you have to
see it in a big screen as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> In my opinion, like I went to go see it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, cause I went to go watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Obviously I wasn't born
when it came out in cinemas </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but like a couple of years
ago they did a re-screening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of it in Sydney, in Australia at four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was like the 30th anniversary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the movie or something
on the big screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I loved it on the TV </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like watching it in my room
and was like fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But watching it in the
cinemas was like, Holy shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this is like an adventure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this is, this is
just like such an out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of body experience with
just the music is God like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the voice acting is incredible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like everything about that has
every, every single element </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that movie has a quality that can still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stand to like modern anime, cinema empire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, and I think that's
why it's just so incredible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because you watch it
and you forget, Oh shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this was made 30 years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but that's my point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I completely agree that it's
an experience that can stand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out in modern anime cinema. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's but I'm saying
it's, it's definitely not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as mind blowing as it was back then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I mean, I think
it's still mind-blowing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every time I rewatched it, I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I can agree with both. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not saying it's
the best Anime movie.- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, Of course.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, Jesus Christ, it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I could easily have
you read the Manga though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's part of
why I didn't enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it just felt like it
felt like it kind of just ended. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was, it didn't feel
like a complete experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well does the Manga continue after? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Manga is twice as long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the movie actually
the movie, the ending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> of the movie is completely original. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because Ultima released the movie halfway </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into a curious serialization
because the first like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> three volumes was so
popular that they were like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we gotta make a movie
of this and they made it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but they were like, I haven't
finished the monkey yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> What am I going to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro? I'm trying to finish it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So the movie is completely original </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like the Munga continues for another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like four volumes off to
the point of the movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's insane, it's fucking insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I highly recommend it,
and I'm not just saying it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as like a super fan of Akira. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just think in terms of like storytelling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> am just like, you know,
I'm just throwing key tones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) honestly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> story telling.
- Characters, development. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like honestly though, it's good shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whoa, how many more buzz
words can I throw in here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Four progression synergy? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again I don't think
it's the greatest piece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of like anime cinema
out there, but like, I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I easily, it's one of
those movies where I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't be fooled by the fact
that it's 30 years old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I still think I can easily
recommend it to new watches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can definitely still watch it today </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and not feel like it's dated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Especially as like, as like a, for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a visual experience and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just feel like, you
know, it's I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe it's cause like cyberpunk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> has just kind of died recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, for the longest time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until what recent cyberpunk
Academy we got recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Dora head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's I mean, seeing, seeing a world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that is a lot less,
you know, a single word </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that now is a lot less
common than it was back then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But cyber punk was kind of in its prime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eighties was like, like, say like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like you can still
watch a Kiran feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hey this is something I
can't really get today </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just because cyber punk is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really rare to find out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because to me like Akira
is like one of those movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like those anime movies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where every single person I've asked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who is clearly not an anime fan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I asked them, what anime
have you watched or enjoyed? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 99% of them will say,
oh, I watched the Akira </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I thought it was fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's just a good movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a really good movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It almost defies anime in a
sense which is really weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it is (all laughing)
which is really weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, wait, wait, how
what'd you mean defies anime? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What does that mean, what does that mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it goes like it an
enjoyment factor in it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't exactly like describe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure if someone can
explain it better than me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but doesn't it there's
some thing about Akira, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the experience of watching Akira </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you don't necessarily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even have to really like animates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Which is really weird, because
I actually watch Akira, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It is animated fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like everything about that is so anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and yet it somehow is almost
not anime at the same time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really hard I don't
know how to explain it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can relate to what you're saying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just to throw out my second heartache </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess.
- Go on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if I've said
this on the Podcast before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think I've said it in other places. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I hate Ghibli movies man (laughs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I only liked like three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I like one or two and even like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which ones? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Princess Manake and NASCA </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you like House Moving Castle? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really like House Moving Castle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really like House Moving Castle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The reason I don't like Ghibli is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just because I don't like Disney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't know because Ghibli, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I see a Ghibli movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, this is an anime
like this is an animate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a fucking Ghibli movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can we also talk about how Miyazaki </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as like fucking asshole? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, he's an absolute con. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you see the clip of
like him going to his sons? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you going to
recommend that clip as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - To this clip, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You can search for it, but
he goes to his son's premier, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's making a movie right? A Director </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he walks out of the premiere halfway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> through being like, he's not an adult yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, oh, he's one of those dads. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Who's like, he's not,
he's not an adult yet, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I haven't deemed him worthy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, shut the up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he goes up lit a cigarette </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just like,
yeah, this movie's trash, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could have done better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He hasn't grown up enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, are you fucking kidding me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - As if, as of me as like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> he hasn't made movies himself, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like not every, like I love
Ghilbi don't get me wrong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but have I enjoyed every
single Ghilbi movie? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Absolutely not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just hate the kind of Director </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who is like everyone else is unimportant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> than my ideas are the best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, he sees me,
he gives off that vibe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and as much as you know cultural icon for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know many parts and
you don't want to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an asshole you don't want to,
talk to anyone for no reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because every single time
you see him in an interview </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or do anything he just seems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like a come to be around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You would hate to be around him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can tell, like he's
such a close minded dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because apparently the only
movie that Miyazaki is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he has made that he himself
cried too, was the Wind Rises. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I can tell you that is the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> amid Ghilbi movie I've ever watched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've heard good things about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But compared to other Ghibli
movies, it is misfolded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What are your favorite
Ghibli movies then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Princess Monaca is easily my favorite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, obviously I grew up watching like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Now star and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How's movie castle is really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought Ponyo was okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ponyo was boring as fuck man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think Ponyo is very much the Jubilee </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the new generation, oh, sorry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> The Totoro of the new generation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Totoro, oh my fucking God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fell asleep during Totoro man I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why am I watching a kid's show now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why do you expect me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, yes,
Totoro is a kid's movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why I don't recommend
it is it's a kid's movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But so it's Toy story,
but I can watch toy story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Toy Story, the Pixar has done a thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they've managed to get intermingle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like very adult humor with them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's Kids like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> media is great when it can be enjoyable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But Japanese media does not do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It does sometimes though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not glibly though (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah not glibly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is it the fucking one
with the pig flying a plane? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Hosts] Porco Rosso </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I had to turn it off 20 minutes in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like soo fucking bored.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I enjoyed it, but I thought it was okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's not amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like that's basically my experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> with a lot of Ghibli movies is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> this is the most okay
film experience I've had. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I like okay, the
reason I really can't get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into a lot of Ghibli movies, is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they just don't feel anime, I don't know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know because they feel
like Disney movies, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I know like Miyazaki
has gone on record like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> criticizing a lot of anime animators </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are like then they're
just like inspired </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by other people working in
anime inspired by real life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, this is why
I go into the medium dude, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do I hate that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate the thing that I like as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was a mistake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - On top of that, knowing
that he's an it makes it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> so much worse for me to
like try and enjoy it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think you can make great ship </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without being a huge camp. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think maybe if you cure
every single type of cancer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know in your lifetime,
go ahead, be asshole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you probably didn't get that passed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, it's that whole thing like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know you should separate
the creator from the creation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but sometimes it's really hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's really hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - When a person markets that work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so heavily as their work, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's a homey Zacky
film, it's not a film, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a Homey Zacky film, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So then it's like, well,
he's kind of a camp. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's kind of like,
you know, yeah, I agree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean sometimes it doesn't detract </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on like how good this specific work is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because you enjoy work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Doesn't mean it doesn't
necessarily mean you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, you I forgot the first
thing of what I was saying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Every time I enjoy the work doesn't mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't you have to like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I agree with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's also like when
you don't like the work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> knowing the guy is kind of you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like, God I fucking hate this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But most people don't know that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I turned off Porco
Rosso halfway through, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like you're not an adult yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You haven't done it, you haven't done it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I walked out of my room, cigarette. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to walk out the room, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put my arm on the doorframe
it's not ready yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird though, to me like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my favorite is Miyazaki film
isn't even a Jubilee film, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the Lupen III movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like way before Ghilbi, the
castle will that shit's dope. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, yeah, I don't know it's (sighs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wonder was he always like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or is that something that
happens when everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> tells you you've you've come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> down from God to bless us with animation? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would say it's the latter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's also like old 150 years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He's retired like a eight times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would like a to think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when I get old I'll be
the fun kind of old guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The one who's like, I give a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about what the young people are doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Instead of being like, I hate life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You say that now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah you say that now,
as like a 20 year old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hope, I hope, that's
why I said I hope. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I doubt Miyazaki is in
his twenties was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to grow up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to grow up
to be an absolute cunt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll reject all my statements. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If I see him, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If he comes out, it's
the whip, I'll forget. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll take (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like browsing
Twitter to be like, oh man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they think I'm an asshole,
I better change my ways. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, what I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - They think I'm an
asshole, fuck the haters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't care what he
thinks, but I, you know, if he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if he wants to see it and
think I've, you know, whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean, all I'm saying
is that you don't have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> be an asshole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You could be, you really
have to tell your son </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his movie was in front of the cameras </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and go out of this, did you really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you really have
to have the cigarette? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This really feels like a
drive home kind of thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like a son, it wasn't that
good, but don't worry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wasn't going to embarrass
you for all the news </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> outlets that were
waiting, it's your son for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for fuck's sake, are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was the thing that broke you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the thing
where I'm like, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, this is too much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You purposely went out of your way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be a cunt, like you could have waited </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> till he got home and texted
her and been like son. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's the thing that like the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I watched the highlight
Zaki documentary years ago </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was such an interesting document </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you'd get to learn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about his life and like he's
full process about everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I don't recommend that
like documentary to people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> nor do I want to rewatch it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because in the entire documentary, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> homie was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just an absolute
dick to the interviewer.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's just kind
of like, just answer the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> question, like a normal person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like when people are
just making things difficult </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the sake of it, and
then you have this whole, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm the best, I know everything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, it's so frustrating
to have to put up with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you have to be an asshole though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why, why did, why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, what did you gain from that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Does that make you feel big? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you feel, I should feel better? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, just be nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like Stanley Kubrick
have the same thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Apparently Stanley Kubrick was Dick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Apparently directors
in general tend to be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - When some of the most talented people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and talented visionaries are
probably some of the biggest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, especially with the Director </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where it is literally
like you have to be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> put your foot down because I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a great YouTube video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> was like are all Directors dicks? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was on my recommended
for like a million. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love that tittle,
are all Directors dicks? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's actually really
interesting go watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And it basically just he
interviews a ton of Directors </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> asking them, you know
should you be a dick? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> A lot of them would be like, yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I am because I have to put
my foot down constantly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and tell them no, you know especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're working with
some actors who are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get being a dick on the job, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, when it's just like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is what I mean like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can be a dick on set
to get what you need done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But did you have to go home.
- Humiliate the interview? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Humiliate your son,
do you have to do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that, just that, that really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know what it
was when I saw that clip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it really struck a nerve with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I didn't mind him
being an asshole sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was a guy like
whatever, that's his thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the office gets it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then when he did that,
I'm like, that is just cruel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I think what hit me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about that clip was that he
did that in front of camera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Camera's you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All the other, all
the other people there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because all the other old
men came out afterwards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it was good, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like, no.
- And he just left. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember there was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Shot of just him going down
the stairs and be like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dragged his wife out with him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, Oh my
God, you guys chill out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm off back home now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's just kinda like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of those things you're like, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't want to be like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't think I have the life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could do that to my kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like your son, like making his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> first YouTube video and you
just like pause and walk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - My parents didn't do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - They up Brunel game week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They pretended like they got it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know they didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I appreciated that
they sat through it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just have this image of you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like you seeing your son
doing his first YouTube video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's a like reaction
video or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, son </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I expected better from
expect creativity from them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't, I didn't raise a son to meet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for him to grow up, to
be a reaction YouTuber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which PC, is it in?
(mimicking breaking PC) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean it was, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like I said, it struck a nerve. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck, I was going to say something else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like totally forgot I had, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, bottom line just don't be a Dick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like, I read an article as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Miyazaki actually openly said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that he was just never there
for his kids growing up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - After that video
- Because of course he was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that makes sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - YouTube is making a movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but then that's when you want
to finally come through right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's your kid's movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You finally want to be like, son. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know I wasn't there for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but God you did me proud dad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Could you imagine he
probably spent his whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> life chasing that, that moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One moment where he just
needed this dad to be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what kid you did
good, I watched the movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was better than half the
ship made is Zackey May made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched the movie out of pure spite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know what it was called. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would've said it was the best movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I haven't seen it, but I
heard it was really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty bad (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Come on, come on just say it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's probably universally agreed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's one of the worst
movies Ghibli has ever made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, I feel mad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel bad, but man, you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel bad that Miyazaki just. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Talk to son. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause like, no matter
what, as a parent got to-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel so much better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This could have been a snuff film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would have sat through
my kid's first movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sitting through that, like I have to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No matter how bad it is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you got to have your kids back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Give it like, no like no parent, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like goes up to their five-year-old looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the macaroni artwork
and goes that's shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Lights up the cigarette. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I expect a better from his son. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Son, I saw the other kids
macaroni on it was much better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than this, you know.
- They use the gluten free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay though, have you
ever had a show or series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where you really, really
enjoyed and then something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> came like you enjoyed before and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You learnt about the
creator or the author. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And has that like affected
your view of the show at all? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Absolutely, when, what happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to the Rurouni Kenshin right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Recently act age happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I was enjoying act eight so much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> This is one of the most unique
Shawnee jump experiences. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And then that happened
and I was like, well fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of don't want to read it anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And people want to
always be like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you should separate them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's so hard to do that when you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you really respect the work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially Rurouni Kenshin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because like this is coming from a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> massive Rurouni Kenshin film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, I can't read it anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no it's it was one
of my favorites show in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Manga and anime hang up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I still have the volumes on my shelf. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like gathering dust now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's, hard as well
because you almost respect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because you, the work so
much that came from the mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you almost respect
like the thought process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the creativity that
came from the person right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It all came from a mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think what's disturbing
is like what all these such </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> amazing ideas came out of the
same head that was like, Oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I should, I should, you know,
collect this not good stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember I was really
into acting as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then after the news came
out, it kind of looked at some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of the, like some, some of
the plot points of that age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whereas like, like we look at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> An older guy grooming this 15
year old school girl to become </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like one of the best
actresses of all time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, it was cool
without that knowledge too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just think, Hey, you
know, maybe you're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Trying to help her as like, as like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Actress, you know, it was, it was like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But now you kind of see
like the underlying reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as to why, he choose that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now there's just this underlying reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just makes you really uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, like I can't
shake the uncomfort. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe that's a complete coincidence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> We will never know the fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that we can now make that correlation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It just makes it that
much more uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then you see people on Twitter, like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but was it legal though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what does it matter if it's legal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I just don't want
to support a pedophile </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really just seeing the
replies to the Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on that was just like, Oh my
God, I hate this world so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because people clearly
like to show who I like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was only one, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, yeah, it doesn't
matter if it was only one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - One is more than zero. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was only one murder,
your honor, I swear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come on and give me a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I Wasn't a serial killer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Give me more credit than that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no, I was so disappointed in that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, why is it
always the good shows? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't, I wouldn't even care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> if it was like the
mediocre shit that like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Ghazi swing, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - If it was like the
fucking Ghazi swing, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Then I'll be like, yeah, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, I didn't
even enjoy it to begin with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but why is it always the
good shows that it happens? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's always like the most talented shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a shame, it's a shame. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a shame, Stop it (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you know, what's not fucked up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Our beautiful, patriarchs (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love these guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - The segues ever (laughs) I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you really just segue? </SPEAKER_03>
