<SPEAKER_05> - Wake up, gamers! It's
time for Trash Taste! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's time for Trash Taste! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Oh, that hurts me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (cheerful music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wake up, gamers! It's
time for Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I am your host for today, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And with me are a bunch of sleepy boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why are you laughing?
- Oh, I just get reminded </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the honey wake up,
new Trash Taste episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] (laughs) I
love that. I love that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was that energy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But yeah, I'm your host for today, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and with me is Connor and Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - What up?
- And do you know what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You seem so just disinterested in... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I don't- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, I mean, we've
been around for what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 90-something episodes now.
- We're the boys. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, I don't fucking
know who's this guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's episode 90-something.
- This fucking Australian. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know who we are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wake me up when they become the men. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then I'll be woke. Then I'll be woke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know if you
know my username but uh... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm growing it back. I'm growing back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd argue I'm the only man in here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think we all, since we all shaved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at all the same time I wonder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's gonna grow back the fastest now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think we're all kind of
growing at the same rate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - You got a black beard, through. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think that doesn't count.
That's not full stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, you got a black what?
- You got a black beard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got a black beard.
Why does that matter? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because that means that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - My favorite "One Piece" character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - All right, badass pirate, by the way. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really lacking in creativity
with this pirate's name, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but obviously you're... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait till I tell you
about Whitebeard. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You'll never believe what he looks like! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - But yeah, finish your sentence, Connor. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Black is darker than brown. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] Yes, yes, okay. Thank you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - What a hot take.
- [Garnt] Thank you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Thus it stands out-
- Can we fact-check that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Can someone fact-check that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- It stands out more. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - It stands out more?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well, let's get the ruler out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Let's get the ruler out
if you wanna go there. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - We're going down to the millimeter. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Does your face feel
heavier with black hairs? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - (laughs) What? With black hairs? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - I know black paint is
heavier than white paint. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Is that true?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it actually?
- Yeah, it is true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - That sounds like it could be true, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> but that also sounds like it
could be completely bullshit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So are you saying that
a head of black hair </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is heavier than any other color of hair? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, on that scale where your hair </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> is not of a significant weight in general, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's very minimal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> But like let's say, I learned this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was looking at weird
ways that planes save costs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which actually ties in nicely
to our topic later, travel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yes, travel.
- So if you're traveling, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason why you don't see black planes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, 'cause they're heavier.
- It's heavier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I thought it just
would have cost a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to paint the damn thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well no, they paint it white. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would have thought
they painted it white </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because of reflection.
- The heat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's that, too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or maybe like the heat that it takes in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's that too, but
it's also twice as heavy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Twice as heavy? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I believe black paint is
twice as heavy as white paint. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Damn!
- Okay, I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Well... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Crew] White paint is
thicker than black paint </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so I don't know if that fact is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just like black hair
nerfing itself, obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like nature doing
a balance patch, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think it's something
to do with the pigments. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - We couldn't be too OP here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's the weirdest balance
patch I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> White hair is thicker than black hair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because black hair's
heavier than white hair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - God's like, "Shave off a few pounds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> We gotta level the
playing field right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Crew] Got it wrong,
white paint contains </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> higher solid content than black paint </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so white paint's actually heavier. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Solid content. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Crew] No, no, actually it's- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Crew] No, no, referring to airplanes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - They're referring to airplanes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Crew] Yeah, no, that's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - So wait, so white paint
is heavier than black paint </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is what you're saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Crew] Yeah, 'cause
they require more pigment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in order to achieve the
same level of saturation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So then-
- Are you sure? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm pretty sure that's wrong. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - So then why do we not have black planes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Crew] Yeah, this is
considered, this is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's not that deep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's purely just because
it reflects more of the sun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it doesn't turn the
plane into a fucking oven. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think you're- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're sounding like fucking
flat earthers right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yeah, white paint's clearly heavier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, yeah, this is the
reasoning behind it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that what a flat earther uses? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, but have you seen
a black plane before? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How do you know?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> We've clearly never been around the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the same amount of pseudoscience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're saying right now, I feel like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> None of us are even close to scientists, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and you could logically make
an argument for both, I feel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and come out on top, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but if even the
fact-checkers can't confirm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] I mean, to be fair.
- [Connor] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It would make sense
if the planes were black </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because then it'd be easier
to spot in the sky, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it would be harder to
spot in the nighttime, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it would be
completely invisible then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's completely invisible anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is so confusing.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You can't see a bright-white
plane in the night. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I Googled, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Does black paint weigh
more than white paint?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Google said, "White paint weighs more." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But then I go to another
article that says, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Black paint weighs more." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - So bottom line, we don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So bottom line, nobody knows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No one knows.
- Google won't agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Scientists cannot even
agree with each other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if black or white is
heavier than each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you ever been in a plane
that wasn't painted white? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I believe I have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The ugliest plane I've ever been on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like a shade of like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was with you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - easyJet, easyJet isn't that ugly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was like a shade
of highlighter orange. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - easyJet isn't that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Oh, that is fucking disgusting. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not that ugly.
- It's a gross color. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know they paint it
so that they don't have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> to keep fixing the impurities
on the chrome or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, is that what it is?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's cheaper to just
paint it again than it is to- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I thought it was
like a branding thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, obviously it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well, we have to paint it to save costs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We might as well brand it a little bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But is it heavier than
white or black paint. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably. It's probably heavier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But maybe the branding is
worth it for marketing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's probably lighter, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because it's easyJet so it's
got to be cheaper, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Surely, surely, surely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - They gotta save the fuel somehow, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I don't know, that is... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I guess now that I think about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's the only plane I've been on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a completely
different color from white. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never really thought about- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I've been on the Pikachu plane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was gonna say, aside
from the Pikachu plane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the ANA one, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the ANA yellow one.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All Nippon Airways. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought I was gonna be more excited </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> getting on that plane, but
then I realized I can't see it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from the inside.
- You can't see it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] You can't see
it. You can't see it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's like, oh, it
just looks like a plane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is what it feels like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get a sick skin in a first-person game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, dude, what a badass skin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I can't see it.
- Yeah, then I can't see it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What an amazing skin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - And what's the point? What's the point? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I never got that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Why do people care about
skins in first-person games? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you can flex it on
all the people, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, it's a flex on other people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - You see your arms and
that's pretty much it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's to show dominance
amongst your fellow players. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- To make them know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you have the samurai armor in "Halo" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> you have an absolute massive cock. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I obviously have not played
enough first-person games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> but we're not talking about games today. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What are we talking about? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because I thought it would be fun </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> to actually do a themed episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It's been a while since we've
done a themed episode, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - The music episode was the last one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is the most scuffed
themed episode, by the way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> We haven't written anything down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> We're just winging it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, sometimes
we don't have to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, by themed episode, we have a topic </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I hope we're gonna stick to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Okay, I'm not gonna- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] We're gonna
start talking about- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not gonna guarantee
that we're gonna stick to the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I guarantee we'll talk about
"Among Us" in 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Something's gonna happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Probably, probably.
- Probably, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I feel like now that
we're getting ready to travel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and now that it seems like the country </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> is slowly opening back up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, at the time of recording, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan have finally let in
work visas and student visas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after like what, two years, is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like two and a half almost, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And who knows what the
situation is going to be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> when this episode actually is released. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Maybe the country will be
open, and maybe a bunch of you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> are going to be traveling
to Japan for tourism. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Don't lie, Garnt. They're
not gonna open it, they're not. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, the best case scenario is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before the year ends people
start coming in again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - So hopefully this
episode will come in handy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> when you do eventually come to Japan. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I mean, it's probably
gonna be a while, though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Lots of time to plan out your route. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, you know, like
many have pointed out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan, unfortunately, has an
extremely older population. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And old people don't really leave Japan, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and a lot of them have never left Japan. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Never even gone out of the country. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- So a lot of the people, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think it's like 80 or something, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> 90% of people agree with the travel ban. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas other countries
like Europe, UK, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> "Well, I gotta have a
holiday in Benidorm." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "My cousin's from, he lives
in Poland," or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course people in the UK
want the country to be open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because otherwise they'd
be stuck in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, exactly,
exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And where the fuck is there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go on a holiday in the
UK, Butlins, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, which is why it sucks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause obviously a lot of
people from America, Europe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> don't really understand
why Japan isn't opening up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like, well, you
need to kinda understand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the general consensus.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, it's also because
Japan puts probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most amount of effort
into their domestic tourism. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well yeah, I mean, that ties </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> into the whole elderly population. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, elderly people are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I wanna travel, but I don't
want to get on a plane." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I know, I'll get on a bullet train </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and go somewhere completely different," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> even though it's, you know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But let's just be optimistic.
For once guys, for once- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, fine. I'll stop
pessimistic for once in my life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] For once, for once-
- That's a tall order, Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - For once, let's just be optimistic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and let's be like, you know what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe the old people
will change their minds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, you know what, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tourism, tourism good,
right? Tourism's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty sure every single war is started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> because the old people
haven't changed their minds. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty much. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So yeah, so let's say Japan is open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you are planning a trip to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you've heard us talk
about a fuckton of things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like about close to
like 100 episodes now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you don't know where to look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we've been talking Japan for what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> About Japan for 100 episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you don't really know
even where to start. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or maybe we've said a
location place and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What or who is that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so we thought it'd
be fun to have an episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's just collectively
what we actually recommend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or don't recommend about Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you're gonna plan a trip, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> use this episode as like a
placeholder just to listen to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, "Oh, that
sounds interesting." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And if the place
sucks, you can blame us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. (laughs) Pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Obviously it depends on
how long you're going for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the big one.
- Yes, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - We're talking about five days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Maybe you can still go out of Tokyo. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Five days, you can very
easily just stay in Tokyo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and have a great time.
- [Garnt] yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, the first two
times I came to Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I never left Tokyo.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mainly because I was scared and- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of the old people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, they were gonna beat me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, using the Shinkansens and
stuff is kind of intimidating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is daunting, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - If no one's ever helped you do it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It's intimidating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because obviously in
Tokyo there's a safety net </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because a lot of things in Tokyo are built </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> with the idea that there's
gonna be people from abroad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coming to visit, right,
so a lot of places- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] That too.
- A lot of places have, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, English menus still. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's way more friendly and open </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> whereas if you go outside
of Tokyo you wanna go eat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're just like,
okay, this restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably doesn't have English on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Dark Souls" level difficulty incoming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This 70-year-old shop owner's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably never seen a
foreigner in her life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly, exactly, and it is daunting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Even nowadays for us, even
though we're well-traveled, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes, you know, I can do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but sometimes I have to psyche myself up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm Japanese and I get intimidated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause they look at me and they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> "You're not Japanese." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like,
"Oh God, what do I do?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know when it happened. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just stopped giving a fuck </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> about being awful at
Japanese a few months ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so now I just talk.
- Yeah, you get over it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if I do good,
but I always get what I need. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - So whether or not I'm
doing it right or not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I get my tonkatsu.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, just pretend. Okay, POV, POV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You've just landed and you're
on a trip with the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're gonna show you around.
It's your first time to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Life hack number one, fly to Haneda. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes.
- Don't fucking fly to Narita. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes, actually, actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> that is step number one.
- Top three locations in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that suck ass, Narita Airport. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which, I mean, it might not be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you might not be able to avoid it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depending on which airline you fly with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I know a lot of the major airlines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like Emirates and those all go to Narita. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- NRT. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You want to go to HND if you can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you have to get a train. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - For one, Narita's not in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Narita's in Chiba, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like in the middle
of fucking nowhere. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's further from Chiba, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, also, to get into Tokyo
will cost you like 50 bucks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, oh, it depends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> If you go on the Narita Express, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> which is the most famous
bullet train-esque thing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> from Narita airport it's
like, it's so expensive. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's actually like 80 bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> if you go with the Narita Express. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - But there's a Skyliner
as well which you can get. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I didn't know about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first time I came to Narita. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they don't advertise it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] They don't advertise it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only advertise the Narita Express </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's convenient.
- Which is half, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yes, because the Narita
Express is the big kind of- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It goes to Shinjuku, right?
- Yeah, it goes to Shinjuku. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, okay.
- Yep. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But yeah, it's the big
one that's advertised </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> about how to get into Tokyo. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> And a one-way ticket there
using the Narita Express </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> costs about, I think, 80 to 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, fuck that. It's like
200 bucks if you go to Narita- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And the first few times I went to Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I did not know that
there were other choices </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that you could make. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So if you have to fly to Narita, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we highly recommend the Skyline. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, Skyliner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is cheaper than
the Narita Express. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's cheaper and it
stops at more places. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Basically, when you get
off your plane at Narita </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you're done, go to the trains </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and there'll be a bunch of ticket things, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but there'll be one specific
office that says Skyliner. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't miss it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They speak English as well
so go there and ask them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's about 40 bucks, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - And you pay like half the price, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, and it's great.
- And it's just as fast. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's got a vending machine on the train. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's actually just as
fast which is why I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why is the Narita Express
twice as expensive? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because they can get that money, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- But yeah, go to Haneda. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Haneda's super easy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You're basically in, where
are you near in Haneda? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Nearly Odaiba. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, Odaiba, Tokyo
Tower, all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you're actually,
one, you're in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Two, you can take the subway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, the fucking monorail.
- You can take the monorail. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Dude, the monorail
has a sick view, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can take the monorail.
- The monorail's awesome. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Or you can just get a cab if you're lazy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can get a cab, train, or monorail, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the most aesthetic one
is definitely the monorail. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - A lot of the cabs have
the English-speaking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> computer thing in it.
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I've never used it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I shout at them like, "Go here!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, I've never seen them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe I should test it,
just see how it goes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, give it a go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like we said, first step,
if you can, fly to Haneda. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We highly recommend you fly to Haneda </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you're gonna have such, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're gonna have a way better experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's gonna be less stressful
getting out of Narita. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's genuinely as well
just a really nice airport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's a really nice airport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You get better views and it's also cheaper </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so that's basically every reason
you could possibly thing of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fly to a certain airport over another </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you have a choice,
if you have a choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's not normally expensive to go there, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but the cost of the train
tickets and transportation might- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Make up for it.
- Might make up for it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or even save some money.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it offsets the costs a bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like Gatwick
and Heathrow in London. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Gatwick's a joke. Gatwick's
basically in Brighton. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> What's the fucking point of that airport? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] It's great for me.
- It's annoying as fuck. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's literally not in London. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's the other airport
that you guys have? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Heathrow, Heathrow.
- No, there's one more, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, oh, Luton? No,
don't fuck with Luton. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, no.
- Don't go to Luton. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Then we got like Stansted and all shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even count those
as fucking airports, okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Those, getting to
Stansted and stuff like that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> is more difficult than
the journey to France. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's awful, awful place.
- [Garnt] It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But we're talking about Japan right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] We're talking about Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So POV, you've just
landed in your airport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where are you gonna stay? Where
would you recommend staying? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's the place-
- In Tokyo? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - APA Hotel.
- Oh god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Said no one ever! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you got a lot of options, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, APA Hotel is
literally the same price. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't. Don't do APA Hotel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, but okay, but all right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yes, you might have to
deal with racist books </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> in your hotel room, which sucks, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's like the same
price as a capsule hotel. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a closet.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it is a capsule hotel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, you get
a bed, though. A window. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I would highly recommend
Airbnbs. Airbnbs- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know, I don't-
- ... is my best experience </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> in terms of accommodation
staying in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - In Tokyo?
- Which might be difficult, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> though, because of the recent Airbnb law. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You get some weird, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That got rid of like,
80% of the Airbnbs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even after 'cause I
have stayed in Airbnbs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> since they got rid of a lot of Airbnbs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and they are still like 10 times better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than most hotels in Tokyo.
- What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the reason is because
most hotels in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they are just business hotels, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They come with the assumption
that you're just gonna stay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the guys staying there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aren't even gonna be in
the hotel at all, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, unless you're
staying at like a Hilton, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> everything else is just
like, yeah, a closet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything else is just
a closet or a shoebox. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know, I think
there's some decent ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I've stayed in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know where though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Pretty reasonably priced.
- [Garnt] For a decent price? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, reasonably priced. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure there is but I think- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think you have to look. You do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - You do have to look, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but I feel like with
Airbnbs, there's just, you- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tokyo is absolutely
saturated with hotels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There is a lot of hotels so you- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's 'cause they nerfed all the Airbnbs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you can definitely
find a good hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if that's what you want 'cause I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes you don't want
to deal with an Airbnb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause sometimes it's kind
of a weird experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Really? I don't think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes you get the
key in a really weird way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and sometimes you're in
an apartment building </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and you get stared at and stuff
and then also you're like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You go to the neighbor's
house, knock three times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and sometimes you
don't really understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how the locks work and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A hotel sometimes is just
like, boom, card, in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's services, they can
do your laundry and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get it, I get it.
- I just feel like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's up to you. It feels like how- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] It's up to
you, but like to me like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Are you a Garnt or a Connor?
Or Joey just lives here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Connor just likes to
be pampered all the time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - He just wants everything
done for him, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I'm on a vacay, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A little vacation. A little getaway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I wanna worry less about things.
I want a safe in my room. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but you're also
probably staying at a Hilton. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not staying at a Hilton. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's like a one-night
thing if I'm lucky. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, that's, the
wallet, oof, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it's a waste
staying in a luxury hotel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for more than one day
'cause you wanna do shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You want to go outside. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just get a hotel with enough room </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where you can be comfortable </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> eating a cup noodle in it if you want. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, let me sell you
on the Airbnbs then, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, Garnt's
gonna pitch it to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I'll pitch a hotel to you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, because with Airbnbs
you have more amenities. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have a working fucking
microwave or one of those, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, a lot of Airbnbs have
one of those mini grills </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so if you wanna go to
FamilyMart or 7-Eleven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or Lawson's and buy the
famous fried chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that Connor and Chris have eaten a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you don't want it cold, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can perfectly just
grill it in your Airbnb. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you mean? It's warm, what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's warm when you buy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do you mean? It's
warm when you buy it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - How long are you carrying around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> this FamilyMart chicken for?
- I don't know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Okay, so like-
- Okay, I will say </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that probably the one country on Earth </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you don't need a microwave is Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's literally one on every corner </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you're allowed to use freely. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That is true. Actually, that is true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - (laughs) I feel like
you just realized that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love as well how that was
your first argument is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "guys, they have microwaves." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - They have a microwave.
- Don't worry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, but no, normally I
find that you get more room </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in your Airbnb as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] You can.
- A lot of the times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the hotel rooms it's just a shoebox </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> where you don't have room to walk at all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's true.
- With Airbnbs- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've had both at Airbnbs.
- Yeah, with Airbnbs, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you actually have walking space sometimes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You have a living space and a
bedroom space which is good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Another thing is that a lot of Airbnbs </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've found in Japan especially, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the come with portable wifi, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So a lot of the times you
don't want to faff around </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> with getting data in Japan
because it's such a hassle, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but with so many Airbnbs,
basically about 90% of Airbnbs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've stayed at, the owners are kind enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to provide you with a portable wifi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which not only works as
the wifi in the Airbnb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but works as a portable wifi
which you can take with you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as you're traveling around Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Although I will say that I think most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if not all train stations
in the Tokyo area </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> have free wifi as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's pretty fucking
annoying to connect to though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, also every
McDonald's has a free wifi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - True, I mean honestly,
just get it from the airport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a bazillion of
these portable wifi- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is expensive as fuck though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Data here is expensive as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially if you're a tourist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're gonna need it
though, honestly, I think- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you are going- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Google Maps is just
literally your best friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- I still use it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - With the amount of walking
you're gonna do, especially. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everything, everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - If you have an international
plan for data or something, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I highly recommend that
because buying data here, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which is why I recommend Airbnbs </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if they give you portable wifi. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Buying data here as a tourist </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is really, really fucking expensive. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like $70 for like two
weeks or something like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for four gigabytes.
- There's vending machines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> at the airport that do SIM cards. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Really?
- That do data-only SIM cards. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Damn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They are quite pricey, but you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it will do what you need to do. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I mean, Google
Translate is very good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - And you can get a
vending machine experience </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right off the bat.
- Right, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You're like, "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've never bought a SIM in
a vending machine before." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a vending machine that actually works." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, there's also,
you can type in portable wifi </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whatever airport you're going to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There'll be ones you can get as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, one piece of advice for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I want to tell people is get a Suica. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because that's gonna be
your best friend as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is a Suica card, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the equivalent to an Oyster card, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> although I don't believe
we use Oyster card. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] Metro cards in the US. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like metro cards. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's really easy because you can get one </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> at basically any machine on the metro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything like that here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It's like 500 yen.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like 500 yen, and you
can load it up immediately. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Every machine has an English option </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and multiple other languages as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you don't need to worry
about learning Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to buy a Suica card. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's super easy, and the
same with bullet trains. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, and also you can pay with it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you don't wanna deal with cash. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Load it up, load up a shit-ton of money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Every single fast food chain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and every single konbini will
accept it, every taxi driver. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Most vending machines
as well, they accept it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, vending machines, trains, taxis. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, with a Suica, yeah.
- Everything, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is very, very useful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you don't remember this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you're gonna be
needing to bring cash. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Do not expect to be able
to pay by card anywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some places do accept it, but don't expect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to come into a place, even if it looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a big establishment that
should have a card machine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of places don't accept
cards or even credit cards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, it is
getting better recently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] It is, it is.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot more places, and
especially since when I first moved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember like half the places I went to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't accept card at
all, but I feel nowadays, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most places in Central Tokyo accept card. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But also, you know, the
Suica's good because, again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you can use it not just at a restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but literally anywhere, so super handy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but also, just
carry cash with you always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're going to need
it for something in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Even if you don't know
what it is immediately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's always gonna be one little thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where this place doesn't
accept anything but cash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a machine doesn't
accept anything but cash. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You're going to need it, so
don't assume we're like in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan's like every other
first-world country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where we have a cashless society. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Especially if you're going
to a mop and pop shop, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where's it's like the old
restaurants and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they'll usually just be
like, "Nope, cash only." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, and I know since
you're watching Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm guessing a lot of
you are weebs, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm guessing, I'm guessing. Maybe, maybe. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, I don't know, huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where are you going with this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you, would you, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What you talking about, Akihabara? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've talked about how
Akihabara is overrated, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Or how we think it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I feel like it still is
one of the best places to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you just have like
a day or two in Tokyo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you've never been
to Japan before, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Because I feel like there's nothing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that really beats that
first-day Akihabara experience </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> because yes, yes, you can get figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a better price online or other places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, it's the magic. It's
the magic of the first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's the magic, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like Disneyland but for weebs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's the fact that
literally every billboard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and building you see around
you is covered in anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Which is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not really a place you can
experience anywhere else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the world or rather,
anywhere else in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> for that matter.
- [Garnt] yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's kind of out of the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's a little annoying
to get there, I'd say. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it's like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like 15 minutes from Tokyo
Station. It's not too bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I say if you're gonna stay anywhere, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stay around Shinjuku, Shibuya
if you want a fun time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I say Shinjuku probably
has the most stuff nearby. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, if you want the
immediate connection. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have Ikebukuro, you have Shibuya. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah yeah, exactly.
- All that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And then you the Akihabara
side of Tokyo which has- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which you can get to quite easily. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, which you can just
cut straight across to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Has like, Asakusa, Ueno,
all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you can easily
spend a day in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh, easily.
- [Connor] Totally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Easily and-
- Every time I go to Akihabara </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> even today I still find new shit to do. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Whether you like retro games,
anime figures, classic stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> like really old Transformer stuff. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Any kind of otaku stuff
is there. Maid cafes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Boys, boys, boy-
- Don't go to a maid cafe. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Don't go to a maid cafe.
- Why not? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> We should be helping them.
Yes, go to a maid cafe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you been to a maid cafe? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Absolutely not.
- No, you don't wanna. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I can tell people to go.
- [Garnt] We've gone to like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Maybe I can get an affiliate account. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There are way cooler themed bars in Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and in Akihabara than maid cafe. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You've been to a bunch, Connor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've been to so many.
- Yeah, you've been to so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you guys have made videos about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney's making videos about it as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone wants to go to a maid cafe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I feel like the maid cafe
is the most basic themed cafe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could possibly go to when there are- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's an experience that I haven't had, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm okay not having it,
but someone else can have it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had the experience, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I have had a much funner time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to the other themed
bars 'cause with maid cafes- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it a bar? I feel like
it's an afternoon thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is an afternoon thing,
but it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just cringe.
- Yeah, but like, it's fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I hated it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just want to see people go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why do you want to see people go? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause you wanna see people suffer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want them to stay in business, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know.
- They're dying, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're dying at the moment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want them to stay in business, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I don't want to be the
one giving them the business. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] What was... (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's a cultural icon over-
- It is a cultural icon, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I feel just-
- Give them your doki dokis. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] It's fun for a
change, it's fun for a change. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I feel with the amount </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of other themed places in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and Japan is very good
at doing themed bars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and restaurants and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I just feel like maid cafes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are kind of just becoming old
at this point where it's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, because like one- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what to expect at a maid cafe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you don't know what to
expect at like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a Lockout or any of those
really cool kinda hidden, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> underground bars and cafes, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What's Lockout? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Lockout is this prison-themed restaurant </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I've been to a few times. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where is it?
- There's a couple. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There is one in Shinjuku, I believe. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh I think I, wait... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where you basically go underground </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through a haunted house and you end up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you eat inside of a cage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is this where they scream half the time? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and then there's a
monster show and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I went there
and I thought the food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> was like the worst food
I ever had in my life. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, the maid cafe food
was a million times worse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I feel like the maid
cafe food, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just 100% of the
time it's horrible food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, it's on par with like, you know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's an omurice.
- It's an omurice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - We only think it's good food
because a cute girl made it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, I don't even think it's a cute- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but most people feel that way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So you're like, "Well,
the cute girl made it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it must be good." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - See, and everything's
overpriced as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, everything's overpriced and- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like 20 bucks
for the most mid omurice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I've ever had in my life.
- Yeah, yeah, right, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know where you get
a good omurice, though? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> If you want like a brand one, Royal Host. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They do a good omurice.
- Dude, Royal Host is lit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Royal Host is fucking great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's one in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like the Denny's deluxe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's so fancy and the
prices are ridiculous. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is what I feel
Denny's wished it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Going to Japan and
just going to a maid cafe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with all the themed bars
or cafes that are available </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> is like going to America
for a burger joint </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and going to McDonald's or
some shit like that, you know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Valid, valid, valid.
- That's like you have so- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] White Castle, I'm there. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You have so much choice
of so many different themes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and different unique concepts, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you go to a maid cafe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they do the moe
moe beam on your food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and call it a fucking day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's it, that's it.
- Thank you for $50. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, and
there's a lot more places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you go to to a maid cafe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Also, I wanna fucking die
when I go to a maid cafe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just go to a maid
cafe at your local con. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's probably the same
experience, to be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] It actually is. It actually is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's honestly the same experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] It's honestly
the same experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Except the only difference
is the one in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you probably won't understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what they're saying half the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Exactly.
- That's the only difference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'll understand when
you go to a maid cafe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm far too British to sit there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I want to see you at a maid cafe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You and Chris in a maid cafe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You and Chris at a maid
cafe would be the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't. That's too much cringe for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, even I'm more attuned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the anime culture and
stuff and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't handle maid cafes at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] No, I couldn't handle it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I'd rather
be seen at a strip club </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> or something like that.
- I would, I would rather. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
- As opposed to that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like that's less
normal. Or more normal, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, more normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I mean, obviously get Akihabara </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of your system because you're gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to go to Akihabara. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're going to have a good time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if you're looking for places to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then just look at our figures special. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We basically curated our figure special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the places that we
like to shop in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are there any other shops </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you would recommend in
Akihabara that they'd go to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh God, there's so many. Why me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I like- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Super Potato is really good.
That's the retro game place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like, what's the doujin store? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, Toranomon?
- Yeah, yeah, that one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, there's Toranomon
and there's Melonbooks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which are two different ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Both are good.
- [Garnt] Yeah, that's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Melonbooks I think
has four entire floors </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of just doujin stuff so if
you like that then go for it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but Toranomon has a better
selection, in my opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And that one has like
seven floors or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is like seven
or eight floors, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Has like seven or eight floors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And there's two buildings as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's two different Toranomons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, because a lot of Akihabara
is, you go into a store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it looks it's just a one-story store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's like fucking tiny, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's full of stuff and then
you go in and then you realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they have stairs, and
then you up the stairs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you realize there's
another set of stairs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you realize that
it just keeps going up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and up and up and up, so a lot of- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And suddenly you're in a mob. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Basically.
- And also, the best thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think, about Akihabara,
especially when you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into the really small unmarked buildings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that each of the floors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is usually a different store entirely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you could be in a
figure store at one point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You go up the stairs and then suddenly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're in an idol shop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then next moment you're
in a retro game shop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Next moment you're in a tech shop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Exactly.
- And it's all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in one building, and it's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, that's why you
can literally spend like hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just in one random
building you stumbled into. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And of course the arcades there as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because if you wanna
go to Japan, I highly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, you have to go to the arcades. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Of course.
- Oh, go to the SEGA ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause they have the fucking
mech pilot game, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That shit was hot.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> What's that one called? And
I can't remember, but... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe don't go to the
ones in Akihabara though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause most of them are gone now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that's true. That's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - All the SEGA buildings are gone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a ton of SEGA
buildings outside of Akihabara. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That have good games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the ones in Akihabara
have a lot of vintage games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes.
- They have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> "Typing of the Dead"
still. They still got that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, they have an entire building </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that just has an entire floor </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> full of old-school '80s arcades. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's got "Crazy Taxi"
It's got a few other games. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's got "Time Crisis II" or three. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can't remember which one it was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You can play a game on the arcades </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> for like 50 yen, I think.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's really good.
- Most arcade games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> are just 100 yen which is $1. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Takadanobaba, there's
the old retro game... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, the one we went to, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That one was dope as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Which is also right in
Shinjuku so easy to get to. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I can't remember what it's called. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Just type in arcade place Takadanobaba. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and yeah, I still
think my favorite arcade game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the mecha pilot game.
- [Connor] Insane, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Have we talked about
it on Trash Taste before? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've mentioned it before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but again, we don't know the name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's literally a hydraulic
mech in this arcade. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'll see it because you
literally are piloting a mech. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - You'll see people fucking tilting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and fucking, it's just sick.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it kinda reminds me
of these old-school rides </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you'd see in malls sometime
or something where it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're put into a capsule
and it's a roller coaster, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and the capsule tilts along
with the roller coaster that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It's like 4-D. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like 4-D that you're seeing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So imagine that except you
control the roller coaster, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So when you pilot this
mech, it'll tilt and curve. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you accelerate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you feel the acceleration
and everything, it's so cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you're a mecha fan,
or even if you're not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it literally is the
closest you will ever come </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to piloting a giant robot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's PvP. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] And it's PvP as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - You literally play against other people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's also like 100 yen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, and it's like five minutes a game. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- It's really good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's battle royal, but if
you are gonna go to the arcade, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> you probably should look at a tutorial </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about how to get the cards
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Oh yeah, save your progress. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because some of them, some of the games, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they will not let you go
past the tutorial stage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you don't have a card.
- [Joey] True, true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like basically, you pay the money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Every rhythm game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, basically every rhythm game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you don't have a card, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're basically just stuck
at the tutorial level. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> There should be a card
printer in the building </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> if it's a big arcade. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Most of the bigger ones have it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So if you don't have a
card, just go to a big one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and there should be a
machine that prints cards, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's like three
different ones, though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> so you need to figure
out which one's which. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's really confusing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure there's a guide online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm sure. Yeah.
- Also, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you're having trouble, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> "What the fuck is being said on screen?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I just hold up Google
Translate to the screen </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> and genuinely it works.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Actually that
is a good life hack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Google Translate, it's not perfect, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> but it'll give you the gist of everything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it will be your best friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should use it.
- Yeah, Google Translate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know this until I moved to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where Google Translate
has a camera option, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it will live translate things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that you put through the
camera of Google Translate. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's been a life saver
for me in a lot of places </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> here in Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is this hand sanitizer or water? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Let me find out.
- Yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And if you are ever in a restaurant </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where it's all in Japanese, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> then Google Translate camera
will be your best friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Unless it's handwritten,
then you're fucked. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Unless it's handwritten,
and then you just got to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just read blindly.
- Then you just gotta hope </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that you're with Joey, and
he'll translate it for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just say "Osusume." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I ask for their recommendations,
and I'm rolling the dice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, "Please, for the love of god </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> give me something good," when I can't- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Usually it's good. Usually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Normally. Normally it's good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Normally it's good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - One time they gave me chicken carpaccio. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was interesting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh wow.
- Raw chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Raw chicken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Raw chicken?
- That was hard to stomach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Chicken sashimi? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that was... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Damn, what
a great recommendation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can't wait to get salmonella. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Mm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - This episode is sponsored

<SPEAKER_04> down in the description below. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, thank you to Athletic Greens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for sponsoring this episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Back to the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I mean, if you're into weeb stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not all Akihabara. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Of course, that's like
the big mainstream place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I personally recommend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for weeb stuff that's
not Akihabara, Nakano. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nakano Broadway.
- Nakano Broadway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was gonna say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I feel like with Akihabara, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get overwhelmed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe that's what you want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe you wanna be
overwhelmed with weeb stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but the problem with Akihabara </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> is that it's very, very much aligned with, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> let's say, weeb culture, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> as opposed to more other
underground anime culture, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which you can find more cool
stuff in Akihabara, I'd say... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> No, no, no. More stuff in Nakano Broadway. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because the way I describe
Akihabara is it's just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> imagine if you're on the
convention floor, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's basically Akihabara, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you're in the dealers hole. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's Akihabara. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nakano Broadway is more
like the artist alley, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> where you can get more of like
the more stuff that's not- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a few shops around there that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the unconventional stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The unconventional stuff, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In Nakano Broadway, there's
a store on the first floor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where they just sell
nothing but old anime cells. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah.
- That place is really dope, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there's other ones
that are from 40s and 50s Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> styled stuff and everything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Huge manga store there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - If you like retro games, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you want Game Keeper
games or something, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that's really cheap, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a place called Book Off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Book Off sell a lot of retro games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Secondhand stuff.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean that's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's so many, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw like Super Mario Sunshine
inbox for like 600 yen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like five bucks.
- Nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, Book Off, it's like
a big chain here, isn't it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- You can find Book Offs </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in most major places, there
is a Book Off somewhere. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> So if you want a good
deal for secondhand stuff- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a bunch of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> There's Book Off, which is mostly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> focused on books and
games and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then there's another one called... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the name's horrible, but
it's called Hard Off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They didn't really think that one through. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is more kind of
like secondhand appliances </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can get games at Hard Off as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah, and then Book Off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you can also buy
secondhand clothes as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a lot, yeah.
- It's pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then there's another
version of the off series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Keep Off.
- Write Off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what-
- Yeah. Sigma Off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck Off.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My big problem with Akihabara </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't just the fact that it's all anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which, that's not really an issue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just you can't
really find anything else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if you want to go out
for a nice meal afterwards, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's nothing really around Akihabara. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the only thing
I've had in Akihabara </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the Royal Host, and the- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Ramen.
- Yeah, the ramen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A lot of ramen places. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Or if you want a drink-
- It's decent ramen, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to be fair. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or if you want, like... sorry, go ahead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. I was about to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but what I love about Nakano, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that Nakano not only has
this kind of cool underground, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like, especially in Broadway,
the whole anime and weeb shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but once you go outside of the
Broadway section of Nakano, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just one building, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it has some of the
coolest bars and restaurants, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean the JoJo bar is in Nakano. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that's the perfect
reason to go to Nakano. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> That's a business I do
wanna stay afloat, Connor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- It's like Grinder. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Fuck yeah.
- It's like Grinder. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Go to DIO in Nakano, the JoJo bar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fucking amazing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a place that we
want to stay in business. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Not the maid cafes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bring your business to
the JoJo bar, DIO in Nakano. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have to check that
they're open on Twitter though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you have to follow them on Twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to see if it's open. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, even though the
Google hours say whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he tweets out whether he is open or not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because it's
literally just one person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's one dude, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> So yeah.
- Very cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's another reason to go to Nakano, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but aside from that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's just so many other cool places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and other cool restaurants and bars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can go to in Nakano, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's one of those places where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you can just stumble upon a place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't need to Google, you
don't need to do a million </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Google which one's like
five stars, or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's one of those places that
you can just get lost in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, that place, that place looks cool." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because everything's so tight knit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And there are so many
tiny restaurants and bars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff like that in Nakano. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because when I
go on holiday, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm not the kind of person </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> who is just planning out everything. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't have itinerary. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> What I prefer is just
going into a cool area </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and just discovering stuff for myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the kind of
traveler that I am, and- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow.
- Yeah, and Nakano- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What kind of traveler he is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, well, well, Garnt,
what a traveled man you are. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- The monk in him sure knows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course, of course, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And Nakano is one of the
best areas for that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I agree. I agree.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I wonder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So we've gone to Akihabara. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What else is something
that you might consider? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> You know, I think, even though, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we don't really go there
that often anymore, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because I feel like it's very much a, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you've gotta do it while you're here. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Just do a tabe/nomihodai. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> Just go crazy for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To go to like a cheap izakaya. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Eat and drink everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like X amount for one hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you remember how many
times we went to Kinokura </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and did the two hour?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my god.
- The two hour lookout. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've gotta go to a Kinokura </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> if you like to drink and eat a lot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Kinokura Monday, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a hundred yen beers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, boys, boys.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - If there's two words you
need to learn in Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's none of this like, fucking,
"Konichiwa, Arigato" shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Korya, open discussion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, korya. No, no, you
don't need to know that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck that shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Osusume, as Connor just
said, and nomihodai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is all you can drink, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the only two words
you really need, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Tabehoudai. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Or tabehoudai. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Tabe and nomihodai. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Tabe is food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All you can eat, all you can drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like you'll know it's nomihodai, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it'll be very bright
and it'll have a number. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It'll be like 2000 something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you'll see a picture
of a lot of drinks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it'll be like 2000 something or... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you see a timer, like
2000 plus 60 something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're either about to hire a person </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for illegal activities, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or you are going to be
having an all you can drink. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So fun for all the family, really? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically, yeah, just go to an izakaya. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Do you recommend going to a chain one? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Dude, go to a Kinokura, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Kinokura or like-
- It's got English </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> on the tablet.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kinokura, or a Torikizoku,
or any of those chains. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Although it's not the highest
of quality in terms of food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think if you want- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Tori, Tori, what's it called again? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Torikizoku. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's decent to.
- Torikizoku is good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really like Torikizoku. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally just all yakitori. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yakitori, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I think they have nomi and tabihodai. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, they do. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you can get all you can
eat and all you can drink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in meat and beer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, come the fuck on.
- And honestly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're saying the food isn't that good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but I remember coming here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no, it's bomb. It's bomb. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's fucking amazing compared to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably where you're from.
- We're probably being spoiled </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> living in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We have been spoiled. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Our food tastes, we've become food snobs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember the first day
that Connor came to Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I took him to a Kinokura </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the moment he got off the plane, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he was like, "It's a
hundred yen for a beer?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Yep." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was like, "Oh, but
it's probably a cup, right?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- Out comes are fucking pint. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, it's good.
- And he's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is the greatest
country in the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Exactly. Exactly.
- Yeah. Literally. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, the food is good. I forget. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I forget, because I've
been living here so long. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're traveling out of England, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the food is like fucking 10 out 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to anything
you can get in England. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is just like a basic hour, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> obviously if you'd been to Japan a bunch, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you would fucking know this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You do whatever you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But this is for the
boys and girls out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who are coming to Japan
for the first time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> having a good time.
- Yeah. First time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Expect everywhere you go to
have the most 10 outta 10 food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you will have the
most 10 outta 10 food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And learn, go do karaoke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Just, just go.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Speaking of nomihodai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, speak of nomihodai, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you will definitely need to
know that word for karaoke, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because basically every
karaoke has nomihodai, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and I don't know why you'd
want to do karaoke sober. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe you do. Maybe you
have a great singing voice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't, I need to be drunk to sing, okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It will probably be a bit awkward </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> because they don't have any English help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Getting it, just, I mean,
yeah, you'll be fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure they're used to foreigners. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, just hold up the
number of hours you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in your hands, and then say nomihodai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and they'll tell you a price, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then you just say yes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I feel there's like a
weird, I guess like stereotype </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of this karaoke culture outside of Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> because I think when most
people think of karaoke, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they think of like open mic,
on a stage and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which is like, I'm not for that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's kind of cringe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love it, dude. I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What are you about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, I can't do it.
- I love that. "Tequila". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like singing in front of
my friends and people I know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in a room, 'cause that's fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We can all hang out and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so the reason I'm not really a fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> of the open mic karaoke. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] I love it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Is because you only get two
types of people that do it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> It's either one, the
fucking amazing singers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who are basically auditioning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for X-Factor or something the next day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or you just get the piss heads
who just murder your ears. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I am the latter. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The thing is, there is no in between. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- You either come out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> getting a free concert, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or you come out regretting
the fact that you have ears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There is no in between. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's never a moment
where someone finishes singing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, "Hey, that was okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I like karaoke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's karaoke bars in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where you can sing with everyone else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love them. They're so fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I remember-
- Everyone gets involved, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone in the bar gets hyped. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but you can do
that with a small crowd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a karaoke room, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, but what if you
just wanna like meet </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> some random Japanese people? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Those things are pretty fun.
- Oh yeah, I mean, but I feel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> there's better ways to
meet Japanese people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> than a fucking open mic karaoke. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, it's the best
way. It's the best. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But like, I remember, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I'd never really thought about it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause in my head, karaoke was always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Japanese style karaoke,
like in a room, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I remember when Felix came to Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I really wanted to
take him to a karaoke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In his head, he was like, "No,
I don't wanna go to karaoke." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And I'm like, "Why?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's like, 'cause he
thought about the open mic shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And he's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Nah, I don't wanna do that." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Oh my poor
sweet, innocent child. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't know what real karaoke is like." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I took him. Connor was there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I went with Dave as
well, from Boyinaband. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- And he was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the most fun that
he's ever had in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I fucking told you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's honestly like
one of the funnest things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can do in Japan, I feel like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think the thing
about Japanese karaoke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that the song selection
is fucking godly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> You wanna sing anime songs? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Of course you wanna sing anime songs. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You have all the anime
songs at your disposal. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> But if you can't sing the Nihongo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you got basically every major song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> from England and America. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, you just pick up the tablet </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and there'll be foreign
songs or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> English option.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can sing Korean songs
and Chinese songs as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the Japanese karaoke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> has a better selection of English songs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than English karaoke in England. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I get that.
- It's insane, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's one of
the funnest experiences </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you can do with your mates. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, you can also get costumes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Oh yeah, we did that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> when we first came to Japan, didn't we? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You can go down to the first floor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You'll know it's a karaoke building, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it will look like something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> out of cyber punk, outside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They always had the neon signs
or the really bright signs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And it's massive, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like seven floors.
- If you see neon signs, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's gonna be pachinko or karaoke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - The inside looks like a palace.
Actually, that's pachinko. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They all look like a palace inside. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, go into the building. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If your ears are bleeding,
it's probably a pachinko. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> If it's not bleeding,
it's probably karaoke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because karaoke's
actually soundproofing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> got the hatches. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - All the pachinko buildings
have tinted windows, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> so you can't see in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- So they're like frosted. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you'll know it's a pachinko building </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause when someone enters
it, and the door's open, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you can hear that shit from a mile away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and like, I feel like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do the karaokes, if they
want to sing anime songs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or Japanese songs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do they have like a function
in a lot of karaokes now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can actually, where
it actually spells it out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> not in like katakana, but in English? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's some. Some do it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- It's super rare there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and the selection is super limited. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're better off just
looking up the English lyrics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> on your phone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's true. That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's true.
- But yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they have like TV sizes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where they actually play
like the visuals and stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is pretty dope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - My favorite things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is seeing what kind of
music videos they play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with your songs that
you sing during karaoke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it's like, I dunno- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Karaoke videos are my favorite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who films that? I'd like... okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's the same people
make the bowling animations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, probably.
- It must be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So if you've never
been to an Asian karaoke, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of the music videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's basically like the
equivalent of a stock image, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just with music videos, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you'll have this
random, I don't know... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One of my favorite ones is where- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the white guy at the bar? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the white guy... yeah,
yeah, you know the one I mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's just like a sad dude at a bar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is such a specific reference </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that only one person will get. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it appears
like every four songs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, or it's like, every Queen song, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just these five people
just dancing on a dance floor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> in this empty bar, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it looks like the saddest
fucking party of all time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a school prom.
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's my favorite. I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and I dunno what, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno what company fucking
film this karaoke music video. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's all British, I think. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're all from the UK.
- That's the thing, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's not Asian people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all either British or
American people that I've seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I actually, that's a
really interesting topic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would actually wanna know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who actually filmed these? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Who made these? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Who actually made these? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - You could ask Joysound or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, maybe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where are these videos coming from? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, can you link me to the video? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because they look like
they're filmed in the '90s. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- They're really old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, because most of them are still </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> on a four by three aspect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're the best. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you know you've picked a good song </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or a popular song when they
have the actual music video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, "Oh, we're
singing good today, boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> We're singing good."
- Well, most of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're selecting the song, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it says if it comes with
the actual music video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. True.
- And if it doesn't, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> then you're gonna probably
get a white guy at a bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because the saddest thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is when you select a
banger song or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> and you're like, "I'm ready," </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then you hear a midi track,
and you're like, "Oh, no." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's always midi.
- Yeah, they're all midi. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - It has a fucking banger
like guitar riff or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just like, "Choo choo choo."- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the worst
midi sounding guitar ever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "Meep meep meep." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's fun.
- But no, karaoke is great, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially with your mates, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's a great way to
just open up with your mates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because normally you go to a karaoke bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't really wanna sing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you don't wanna embarrass yourself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of strangers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but with Japanese karaoke, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can just embarrass yourself
in front of mates, equally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's a hell of a fun time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if you wanna embarrass yourself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in front of your mates in another way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> you can also go to an onsen, as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> A public bath.
- Of course. Yes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Which I think is a much taller
hurdle for a lot of people. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - I recommend just going
to, you can book ryokans, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> which normally have onsens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> You can book them on booking.com. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and even if you
have tattoos, you can- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can get private ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you have the expendable
income, then you can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where would you
recommend for that, though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Because before, we had the
massive onsen in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's gone.
- Onsen Monogatari. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. Onsen Monogatari. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> Unfortunately, we can't
recommend that anymore </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because that was... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's gone. That's so sad. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm so sad, because that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was the perfect onsen to recommend, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because you go to the onsen.
- Salu's not a real one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you'd go to DiverCity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just see the massive
Gundam, and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Goddamn, what a perfect day trip." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, that's the perfect day trip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Unfortunately, that's
not available anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I still think some of the... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> well, I mean, it depends
how far out of Tokyo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you want to go into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, there's a lot of
like small bath houses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in and around Tokyo, in
the more suburban areas, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's not really an onsen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> If you want like the onsen experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without going too far out of Tokyo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd say Hakone is probably-
- Yeah, Hakone is pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's in Kanagawa, which
is one prefecture across, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you can-
- You can get a bullet train. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or not even you can get the romance car. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Romance car.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Romance. Uh-huh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I dunno why it's
called the romance car, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> but it's halfway between a bullet train </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and a regular train. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's more boujee than a regular train, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not as fast as a bullet train, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can go directly
from Shinjuku to Hakone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> in an hour, I think.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's relatively cheap as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - And yeah, Hakone is
a really, really nice </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> little cute small town.
- I love Hakone. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, it's really cool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> There's this really small Eva
store right on the station. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Which I go to every time. I dunno... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And the reason for that is because Hakone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is what they base Tokyo-3 off of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So if you've seen "Evangelion"
and you've seen the movies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you will recognize the trains
that like that they use there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they look exactly
like they do in Eva. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I see Shinji right there
listening to her headphone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, look." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Weebs, discuss. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you walk around,
you see vending machines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and Asuki and Mari and
Shinji is everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really recommend, if
you want a nice kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe a two day trip outside of Tokyo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because Hakone is not only really good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> especially if you love Eva, of course, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like also there's the Jigokudani, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is the sulfur plumes of
like the mountains of Hakone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is really nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never been there before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really dope. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You go up this huge, I
was about to say monorail, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not a monorail, it's like
a... what do they call it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like this... fuck... what do they call it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like a, not a ski lift, but... what? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Gondola?
- Yeah. Gondola, that's it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, you go up this gondola </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> from the base of this lake in Hakone, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and you go up into the mountains </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and you get this really,
really nice view of the lake </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and on a good day, if the
weather's really good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> you can see this perfect
view of Mount Fuji as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So that's really dope. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then you go into this little valley </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> and you go into this
place called Jigokudani, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which is called Hell's Valley. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Japan has a couple of Hell's Valleys. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh I know. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Isn't there one in Hokkaido, as well? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's one in Hokkaido as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's also one
around like Gifu as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, yeah, it's just this
really cool sulfur plume place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can get really close
to volcanic sulfur plumes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It kind of smells like
farts the entire time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sulfur does like farts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's kind of a really
cool, unique experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I personally recommend it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a good day trip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I really, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hakone was the first hot
springs town that I went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I really enjoyed myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The one thing I will say
is, if you go to Hakone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really weird,
because I went to Hakone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I expected it to be
something, not similar to Tokyo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you expect to go to a hot spring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you expect to walk
around and explore somewhere, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but a lot of ryokans, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they expect you to stay
at that one establishment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the entirety of your trip, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A lot of these hotels, and
a lot of these ryokans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will have everything you
need within that facility </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they don't really expect
you to go out and explore, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because normally there
isn't really much to explore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in that immediate area, unless
you take a bus or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least that's my experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So don't expect... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you can go explore, but
if you want to go explore, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you probably need to
plan it out a bit more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the place you're staying in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't necessarily going to be near </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of tourist attractions.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Especially if you're
staying at a ryokan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Having said that, if
you do stay in a ryokan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be prepared to get up and
eat fucking breakfast, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's one thing which- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At an egregiously early time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not sure if I am a fan of it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you do stay in a ryokan,
ryokans are great, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Ryokans are great, because I
feel like, in terms of hotels, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like the most
aesthetic place you can stay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah.
- You are pampered there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the most authentic
Japanese accommodation experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly, and they
normally have the nicest onsens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you could find. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, you normally sleep on a
futon, though, on the floor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So not a bed. So, if that's
something you might... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if you want that
authentic Japanese experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I like it. I like it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Futons, I feel like, are
better than beds sometimes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but right,
people might not want to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - True.
- Some people might </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have a thousand thread count. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - They might be thinking,
"Where's my bed," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when they get there.
- "There you are." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Is that it?"
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if you don't come down for
breakfast at the agreed time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> they will find your family </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and they will kill everyone you love, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or at least that's what I get out of- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's included in the cost as well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> so that's why they're
normally quite expensive, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause dinner is normally included. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they don't want you wasting money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, these dinners are
normally really large courses, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so they're the reason
why a ryokan seems... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Ryokans are normally like
what, 3, $400 a night minimum, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's 'cause half of
that has gone to the food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if not more.
- The food. Mm-hmm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, you will be eating like a king. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You will be eating like king. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So if you see the price of the ryokan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> don't get too shocked at the price, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because you are paying
for the food as well, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's normally
really, really good food. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - High quality.
- It's high quality. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> It might be even a bit too much sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - You'll get a good taste of
local dishes, though, normally. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- They use local ingredients. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yep.
- And it's certainly </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a really good way to
just try Japanese food </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> that you normally wouldn't order. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I'm never gonna order
half the shit they give me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. Yeah.
- Because half of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is super slimy.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I'll always eat it,
because I don't want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to make eye contact
with that small Japanese lady </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who asks me why I didn't like it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which they have done many times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They do, so now I just eat everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just eat everything.
- I eat everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but originally when I
didn't eat something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> they would sometimes just
stare at me and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Why didn't you eat it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's wrong? Are you okay?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "What's your address?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Are you sick? Do you have COVID? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Are you dying?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - "I will find you."
- "I will kill you." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Best advice. Best advice you get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Pillow over the face. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's something you
feel so intimidated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But no, I'd even recommend going to ryokan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> to try the traditional Japanese food </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> over even going to a restaurant, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because with a restaurant,
you don't know what to order. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You look at the menu and it's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> "I don't know what I'm going to like," </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's kind of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ryokan food is kind like
a tasting menu, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You kind of get a little
bit of everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Lots of little small chunks
of a lot of different things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A little bit of everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're gonna find something you like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some things you don't like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's a great way to just easily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get the traditional Japanese experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just don't miss breakfast, because... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did I hear you say they
came to your room once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and woke you up to get
breakfast, or was that Chris? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. A woman literally... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was with Chris.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I was on a
journey across Japan trip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and one morning I got... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, the night prior, I got very drunk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that morning.
- As we do sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As you do, and then the
morning of I was very hungover </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and the lady kept knocking
on my door being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Breakfast ready," and I'm
like, "Yeah, shut up, shut up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I have a throbbing headache right now," </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then she just fucking walks in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and just rips the sheet
off me, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "What are you, my mother?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No way. Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck?
- And she was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> making sure you're alive, and
I was like, "You fucking... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Alright." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She came in and ripped it off? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, or like slowly took it off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's even worse. That's more creepy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I'm like, for one,
I'm freezing my ass off, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> two, I have a throbbing headache, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> three, how did you get in? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - What the fuck? I've never heard of that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. That's an exception,
though, that's an exception. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's something else.
- Most places, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> they'll just ring you up
on the phone to make sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you're not dead.
- I've also stayed at a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Five more minutes,
mum. Five more minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on. Please.
- I've also stayed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> at modern ryokans, if you
will, that are more like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they have beds like.
- Like western ryokans? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and they're way more modernized, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Hokkaido has a really nice one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's called a hotel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, it's like, it has... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's weird, 'cause it'll have tatami mats, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it'll have a bed and it'll have- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I know what. Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Those are usually more
higher up, though, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but they normally... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I find that the
prices aren't different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The really traditional
ones sometimes cost more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than the more modernized ones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they charge a shit ton for food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or maybe they have a lot of workers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> That's one thing. They have
so many workers at ryokans. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> An insane amount.
- They do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But also sometimes the service is nuts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- The moment you turn up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like four of them greeting you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> They'll take all your
bags right away, and then, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh my God, it's so intense. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, "Jesus Christ.
What is happening?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes it's a bit too intense, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because sometimes you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, I- I- I know you're wanting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to make me feel comfortable, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you're making me feel a
little bit too comfortable now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I stayed at three or four
recently with Chris, on a video, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was really, it was basically- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I remember I walked up to one, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and as we were driving into the ryokan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> there was like 10 employees all lined up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like slowly bowed, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I was just like, "Bro, I'm
not the queen. Chill out." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, literally, you feel like it, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You feel like royalty, in the best way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- It's good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's a lot of different price points </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and different kind of
variations of onsens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I've seen the one
with the snow monkeys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that was amazing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the whole town is an onsen town. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mm.
- Which town is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I think there's two. I think
this one's called Yudanaka. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yudanaka. Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yudanaka, and the other one was, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which was famous for having
a big, big onsen pit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't go in it, but, what's
it called... Ku something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there's a couple of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And yeah, honestly, it's at Nagano. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whereabouts is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nagano, so you can drive from
Tokyo if you really want to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can easily get the bullet
train as well from Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Get the bullet train to Kusatsu. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kusatsu, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like the top three
onsen cities or towns. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That was so good, because
we stayed in an onsen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that was literally like one
foot away from the town center. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mm.
- Really cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Really, really cool area. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - The other top three I went
to was Hira onsen, as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> That's in Shizuoka.
- Oh, I remember. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to go to that one.
- That one's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the one where Chris and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bathed in a thousand year old log. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - That place.
- Oh, that one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- A thousand year old log. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, there's a bath made
out a thousand year old log, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was actually really, really nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's in Hira.
- When you guys book onsens, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well I know that's not
a problem for you, Joey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> but do you go with the English sites </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or do you go with the Japanese sites? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can use booking.com super easily. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Unless it isn't on booking.com, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which is quite rare, actually. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I've never really seen anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that's not on booking.com. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's all on booking.com. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- Which is really weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> You'd think super
traditional, but now dude, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can book it all on booking.com. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Have they modernized? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Have they actually? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - They might have.
- I've never seen a ryokan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that I wanted to go to
that wasn't on booking.com. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mm.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why that is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause some hotels aren't on booking.com. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Which is really weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, I stayed at a place one time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they didn't have the onsen built in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> they had a hot tub, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so they would fill the
hot tub with onsen water </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they brought in via truck. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So is that really an onsen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's an onsen if it
has onsen water in it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, okay.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> If you fill a bathtub with an onsen water, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's technically an onsen.
- It's an onsen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I bring sea water in
my bathtub, is it the sea? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the sea bath.
- Is it the sea? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, yeah. It's a sea bath. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A sea bath. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a sea bath, is it the sea though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Is it a hot spring?
- Well, there's no place </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> where you can go for the TM onsen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know the word onsen
just means warm spring? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah.
- True. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can just get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What makes it onsen is
that it has the fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Minerals.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And every single onsen
has the pH sign and stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> that tells you what's outside of it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So they're really strict on
what can and can't be an onsen. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really strange.
- Yeah, legally speaking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I highly recommend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just getting over your
fear of getting naked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in front of your mates, or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and getting in an onsen.
- Is that a problem? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> JoJo fans?
- I think, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a lot of people.
- JoJo fans, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this does not apply to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, doesn't apply to JoJo fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's been a couple of my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> who just refused to go to an onsen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just because they were uncomfortable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with getting naked in
front of me or the mates, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like-
- Dicks out for the boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm like, dicks
out for the boys, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> We all have 'em. It's like, who cares? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'll get over it in five minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a bonding experience.
- It is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It is. It is.
- It's a bonding experience. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love saunas, dude.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno if that's like
a white person thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Nah.
- I love saunas, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like saunas. I just
can't stay in them for long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Love it. I love getting
in the ice cold water. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck, dude, it feels so good.
- Oh, I don't like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't, I don't. You do
the things that I hate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> The sauna and the ice bath.
- I love the ice cold. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Dude, the onsen for me is just
the warm up for the sauna. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When it doesn't have
a sauna, I get so sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but luckily in Japan now recently, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sauna's becoming a trend.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For some reason.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - People are obsessed with
saunas and the health benefits. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there's a lot of
dedicated sauna places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japan now.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And my God, do I love sauna. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I love one, dude.
- It's very white of you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think that it's very, very
white, but I fucking love it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, I guess going back to Tokyo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is there any other places
or areas in Tokyo that you- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know it's a massive tourist trap, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but just go to Golden Gai. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fun.
- Golden Gai's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't go into any bars where a guy's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> telling you to go into a bar.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Go into bars that-
- Shinjuku, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a lot of really
cool places in Shinjuku, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but there's also a lot of
sketch places in Shinjuku, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> so you really have to be careful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Again, if someone tells
you to go into a bar, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> don't go into the bar.
- Don't go into the bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's just a rule of thumb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yep.
- There's a bunch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of really cool bars, not... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so between sanchome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sanchome, there's a ton
of really cool bars, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> behind the malls.
- Yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's a bunch of
really tightly knit areas </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that have a shit ton of nice bars. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Nearly all of them I've
been into are pretty good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's mostly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when we think of like
sketch places in Shinjuku, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> it's mostly some parts of
Golden Gai and Ni-chome, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which is the gay bar district. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I've been to a few gay bars in Ni-chome, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> and they're really, really
fun, but the problem is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of places they won't let you in, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> unless you are going in with
someone who they already know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
- And also, a lot of them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think are very
foreigner friendly either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no. There's quite a lot actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh really?
- Yeah, there's quite a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I went filming there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've been there a few times, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a lot of bars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> that are very, very foreigner oriented. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you wanna experience
gay bars in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and they are pretty dope, at
least the ones I've been to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go to Ni-chome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I think gay bars are
just pretty dope in general. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Check out the one that I went to, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's an anime, anisong gay bar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - An anisong gay bar?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That sounds fun as fuck.
- Oh yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> All the dudes there were
just an absolute laugh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Gay bars are some of the
funnest bars you can go to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I say this as someone
who grew up in Brighton, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> where there was a bunch of gay bars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Everyone's just so up for anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Everyone's up for anything.
- Everyone's up for anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't say. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also, they're just a lot of fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - They are.
- It's just a good vibe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really good bonding experience, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> if you wanna talk to
Japanese people, especially. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Daikanyama has a bunch of cool bars. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Daikanyama, that area. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Daikanyama does have
a bunch of cool bars, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but they do get a bit costly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, they're very expensive.
but they're super, super cool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> There's breweries in Daikanyama. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, the brewery in
Daikanyama is really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that one's sick.
- I don't think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've been to Daikanyama.
- Yes you have, Garnt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have I?
- We've been like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, we've been to the
brewery's in Daikanyama. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've gone there a ton. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which brewery is it again? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Is it the Spring Valley brewery? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, that's in Daikanyama? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I thought that was Ebisu. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every single bar I've been
to in that area is sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, yeah, so I do agree with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We went to the cigar bar in Daikanyama. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Every bar in the area I've
been to is just awesome. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just completely
blanked on the area name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I was just like, that's close to Ebisu. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you can walk to it from Ebisu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ebisu is awesome as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Go to Ebisu as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, basically Ebisu
is just south of Shibuya. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's one stop away, and
I say that it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually prefer Ebisu over Shibuya, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though Shibuya is the
more famous place to go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because to me, Shibuya
is just way too crowded. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know.
- Yeah, no, I get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But there's also a lot of
really cool places in Shibuya </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you know where you're looking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] That's true. That's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shibuya is a lot like Shinjuku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where it is like heavily infested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a lot of tourist traps, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> but also, Shibuya is so massive </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that if you go to Oyama, for example, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> which is the area on the
way towards Harajuku, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that place has a lot of
really cool hidden stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around as well, and it's not
really that far from Shibuya. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think, yeah, one thing I
would definitely recommend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're going into the big locations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> is to kind of try to
venture out of the center, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because there, you do
tend to find a lot of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really cool, hidden stuff
that isn't overpriced to shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- And that applies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to most places in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What'd you guys think of Ikebukuro? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really like Ikebukuro.
- Well. there's two sides </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to Ikebukuro.
- Two sides. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, there's two sides.
- I like the east side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of Ikebukuro.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, west side is
very, very, very sketch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The east is Sunshine City, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and everything around that
area is actually pretty sick. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sunshine City and Otome road. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, all that area is pretty sick. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What I like about Ikebukuro </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that you get a little
bit of everything, you know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It is kind of like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - The way you said that was so memey. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "A little bit of everything."
- A little bit of everything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - You do kind of get a
little bit of everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. Definitely.
- If you just want </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to go to an area and just,
you want to get some anime, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you got Otome Road there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There are some good ramen places around. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, you got some really,
really good restaurants. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Some really, really good bars.
You've got Sunshine City. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and then if you
want a lot of really good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Southeast Asian restaurants
and Indian restaurants, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you go to the west side of Ikebukuro, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's also very scary at night. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - West side is literally like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what happened with the vibe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> but the west side is literally
just lots of sketchy places. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, to explain it to you, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> east side and west side, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not gonna be able to easily wander </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from one side to the other,
because it's literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> east side and west side of the station, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you literally have to
go through the station </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get to either side, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. Or walk under. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's such a big
dichotomy that I don't like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> it's literally a fucking
line that separates one, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the boujee side from the
really, really sketch side, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I don't know how one
station can separate two areas </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> that are just complete
opposite of each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's crazy, on the
train, on the one side, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like, all you can eat, all this, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and the other side, it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> women, 500 yen an hour,
fuck, fuck, sex, sex, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's, "Whoa, whoa, whoa." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a lot of brothels and host clubs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff like that on the west side. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's gonna be a lot of guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to get you into
a lot of girls bars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Just stay on the east side. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> You'll have a fucking good time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - East side's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> East side's good.
- You got a Round 1. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A really big Round 1.
- Very big Round 1. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - And Sunshine City is a ton of malls. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. It's really good
shopping, really good food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Lots of handmade stuff.
- Have we explained </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> what Round 1 is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Americans know what Round 1 is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It's an American thing.
- Is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As well, right?
- I think so. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Round 1, it's arcade
plus bowling plus... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's got everything.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm pretty sure you can live in Round 1. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, right, it's
got fucking everything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> What was the place that we
filmed a video at, Joey? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, The Break Room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Break Room. Is that in Ikebukuro? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's an east Ikebukuro as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's in east Ikebukuro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna go back there too.
- I wanna go back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been thinking of doing another video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, so if
you've seen Joey's video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with me and him doing The Break Room, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> where you get to just
break a bunch of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They have more than that there as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They have like-
- The ax throwing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they have ax throwing there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and, what is it now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's ax throwing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's the ax throwing,
there's a paint area as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that.
- Yeah, where you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spray paint, or you know, just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a really cool place.
That's in east Ikebukuro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you can drink there, as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's got a lot of games there as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - You should also go
to Bagus. I love Bagus. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bagus. Oh.
- Yeah, Bagus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just type B-A-G-U-S into
Google whenever you're here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and I guarantee there'll be one </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> within walking distance
of you if you're in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and you can play, there's
a variety of things, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> the three staples they have
are ping pong, pool and darts. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually recently filmed a
video at the Ikebukuro Bagus, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> which I hope it's out by the
time this episode is out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is that like the grand one?
- Yeah, it's the big one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> on Sunshine Road.
- Wow. Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Next to cinemas.
- What else can you do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> in that one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because some of them have golf. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you can do golf,
ping pong, pool, darts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think that one in Ikebukuro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has the largest selection of manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - And they also have
theater rooms as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh.
- And you can just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> if you rent out movies
from outside of Bagus... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't do it inside of Bagus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if you go to a rental place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> you can bring in games, and
rental games and rental movies </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you just have a room to yourself </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> to just play games and movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also, the darts in Japan
is not, it's no basic darts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This shit is like cyber punk darts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> The board is like a score,
there's animations and shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This thing is so fun. You gotta go. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And, yeah, also ordering
drinks can be kind of stressful </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> if you don't know any Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Basically, there will be
a phone next to your table </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a lot of these places. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> You just call-
- Now they just have tablets. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Do they? Bagus stores? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I went in the Bagus the
other day, you had to call. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh really?
- Some of 'em </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to call.
- Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of them you have to call. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You call up, you just say
the name of the drink you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and then say, ichi, or ni. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Just say it very basic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Three phrases. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The third phase... phrase,
sorry, is nama beer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nama beer.
- Which is just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You just say nama.
- Or just nama. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, which just means the
beer on tap, or the draft beer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or the default beer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just basically
the only drink I ordered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when I came to Japan for the first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - That was good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It was decent.
- Yeah, it was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japanese drink.
- Very drinkable, I'd say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I wouldn't say it's the nicest,
but it's just very easy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It goes down easy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - The thing about Japanese beer is that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kind of like refreshing,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I was gonna say it's like water, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's not doing it justice, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not American beer, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's not water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not Miller Lite, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's no Miller Lite.
- It's not watery. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just-
- It's just refreshing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it's very light, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> without feeling like
it's a very cheap beer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How do I? Yeah.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it goes down really light, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you still get the
full taste of the beer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how they do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like some Japanese
wizardry happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like some of the most
refreshing beer I've had is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess this is a place that
I also highly recommend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> we're going outside, we're
going way outside of Tokyo now, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is in Hokkaido, because- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - How do you get to Hokkaido, Garnt? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Where do I stay in Hokkaido? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where do you stay in Hokkaido? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I've only stayed
near Sapporo, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basic. Basic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But there are several
ways get to Hokkaido </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because Hokkaido is
pretty, pretty damn big. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hokkaido, by the way, is
the big island at the top. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You should go there
because the food is the best </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and the drink is the best, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but, you know, you can get there by train, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's pain in the ass from Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- It's like four, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> five hours.
- Well, I mean, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like four, five hours </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and the last stop is in Hakodate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is five hour drive from Sapporo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, don't do
that. Just fly, just fly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually, I think like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was stuck in Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the price for the planes
was actually cheaper </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than the price for the Shinkansen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Just fly. From Haneda. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - But we're talking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you want to explore outside of Tokyo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe this is your
second trip, third trip, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've seen Tokyo.
- Or maybe you are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just such an adventurer
that you want to go out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Or maybe, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Maybe you're an adventurer,
you want go out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> Fucking highly recommend Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah.
- You know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sapporo is such a cool fucking city. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] It is. It is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Great bars.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go and get something called Jingisukan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fucking awesome, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> It's all you can eat, normally, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes if you're
lucky, lamb, on a grill. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like Korean barbecue with lamb, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's a million times better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fucking amazing, it's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because you're gonna come to Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're gonna cream your pants </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at how fucking good the food is here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like, my God,
this is like peak cuisine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How can it get better?
It can't get better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you go to
Hokkaido, and you are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how have they improved on perfection? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then Hokkaido is
like, "Hold my Sapporo." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll give you good food.
- Yeah, I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how Hokkaido has just made
such good food even better, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because all of the best
Japanese cuisine I've had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has basically come from
Hokkaido, where it's just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Hokkaido, the best ramen
I've had is in Sapporo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you wanna-
- Best seafood I've had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is in Sapporo.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> The best seafood I've had is in Sapporo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you are in Sapporo and you want to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just easily find a ramen joint, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just go to Ramen Alley, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's just a bunch
of different ramen shops there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the airport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Huh?
- In the airport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not in the airport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Sapporo.
- Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - In Sapporo, there's a
place called Ramen Alley, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've been there a bunch of times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to try the different
kind of ramen stores, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's where I've had the best
ramen I've ever had in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And every store there has
a different type of ramen </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's just, they are
all fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They're all fucking bomb.
- I agree. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, just Hokkaido in general. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think if you're gonna go, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we do recommend the winter, at
least I recommend the winter </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> because there's a bunch of snow there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it looks aesthetic as fuck.
- Winter Wonderland. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it is Winter Wonderland. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's where the snow festival is held. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your plane might get delayed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is-
- Like it did for Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is the one downside
of going to Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is, because it snows a lot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're kind of playing
gacha with your plane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, will your plane take off in time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Will it not? Will it get canceled? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Will the entire airport shut down? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, find out when you basically go, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because you can never really
plan around that unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also you can go to Niseko,
which is in my opinion, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the best ski resorts in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is where we went, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's fucking great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Niseko's amazing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It'll probably be rammed with tourists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you watching this, but
I mean, it's amazing though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Really good food. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I feel like I've only
been on two ski resorts now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japan, and Niseko is the superior one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but also it is very foreigner friendly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes.
- So much so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you might encounter more foreigners </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> than you will Japanese people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, dude. It's all Aussies. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's all Aussies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] It is all Aussies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But then again, that's almost
all ski resorts in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just all Aussies.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's good though. A really good area. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Really, really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never been to Hakodate, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's that like?
- Hakodate's chill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hakodate's chill. I like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I had the best crab in my life there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think if you
want the best seafood, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Hakodate's the place to go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Really?
- Yeah, because it's a port. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because that's where
they catch all the seafood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they have a little
fish market in Hakodate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is called the Hakodate fish market. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - So fucking good.
- You go there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> super early in the morning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> and you get literally the catch </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that they caught a couple of hours prior, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> and it is-
- That's amazing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - In my opinion, the best
fucking seafood I've had, ever. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I think even though the
seafood is amazing in Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah, I have to say, in
Hakodate, it was the best. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Next level.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just so good. So fresh.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's also a really small,
quaint little town as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> You can get around very
easily with the tram system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that they have.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what we do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You can walk a lot around
a lot of the center though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can, you can, but you can also go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the nearby mountains as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - True, true.
- And get a really nice view </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> of Hakodate during the night. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, really nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where do you reckon, guys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where do you reckon people
should get the seafood? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Just any restaurant, or do you think- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean even like-
- It's all decent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, even like the
hundred yen sushi places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are all really good.
- All decent. All solid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because the thing is,
even if you go to a big chain, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially like the conveyor belt sushis, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because obviously the
ingredients are locally sourced, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just because, even if you
go to the same sushi chain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you might have been to in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it will taste entirely
different to another sushi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the same sushi chain that
you have in another place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sushi shane.
- Shu-shu shushi shane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so even if you go
to a conveyor belt sushi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't expect that it will
taste exactly the same in Tokyo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as it will in another place you go to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've had that exact
experience where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Holy fucking shit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> I didn't realize that the
equality could differ this much </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> with the same chain.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You know, you think
you go to McDonald's, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you get, most of the time, the
same experience every time, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but with sushi chains, it's just, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's wildly different
depending... no, well not wildly, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because the baseline is good, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- The baseline is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> It goes from good to fucking incredible, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> is what I'm trying to say here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've never had food
poisoning from fish here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's always been sausages. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So, take that as scientific 100% proof </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that that's shit's bust. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's not even chicken
sashimi, or it's chicken- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's the goddamn sausage.
- No. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I think one thing
you need to take into account </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> is that it's actually a
lot harder than you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get from Hakodate to Sapporo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you want to explore all of Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd say it's practically impossible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to explore all of Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> because it's just so massive. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Those two are the big major cities. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Without a car, you can't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, without a car.
- You're screwed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without a car. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I drove around Hokkaido a bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really fun. I really recommend it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's some really cool towns,
like Toyako is really cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Toyako is really nice, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like the best soup curry
I've ever had in my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> is in Toyako.
- So good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I think the drive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> between Hakodate and Sapporo </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like four hours or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Three to four hours.
- Three to four hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Even with a train. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is two hours with- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And most of the time it's just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're going through the mountains. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, which is really weird, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you can really get
tricked by the map, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you go on Google Maps,
and you go Tokyo to Hakodate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like that, and it's
like three hours or four hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the Shinkansen, and then you're like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's no Shinkansen, by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Huh?
- That's not a Shinkansen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not a Shinkansen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Shinkansen stops at Hakodate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, no, no, yeah, yeah. To Hakodate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It stops at Hakodate, right,
so it's like three hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like, oh, okay,
that's not too bad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you're like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe I can explore Sapporo as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's just over there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just there. Yeah.
- It's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right next to Hakodate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you Google Hakodate to Sapporo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like four hours,
four and a half hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- To get like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get like that distance.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you're like, "What,
how does this make sense?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, yeah, that's
something to keep in mind, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is, it's a lot harder
to explore all of Hokkaido </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than it may initially seem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's because when
you're on the mainland Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're so used to everything
being so much smaller, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, all the prefectures are way smaller. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All the towns are more tightly knit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or they're just easier to get to, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Easily to get to.
- Yeah, easier. Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you realize that Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in terms of prefectures, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> is so much insanely larger </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> than the next biggest prefecture in Japan </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that you kind of forget that, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> oh, yeah, this place fucking is massive. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- It's impossible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to get around.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are there any other
places outside of Tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that you guys-
- There's the obvious, Garnt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Kyoto.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are we gonna talk about Kyoto? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - What, are we nervous?
What, is it canceled? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kyoto's canceled.
- I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if we can mention it after what Kyoto did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think Kyoto is still great to go to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - You're gonna go to Osaka, right, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because it's a fun place.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And you might wanna go to
USJ, see the Mario World. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> You may as well go to
Kyoto. It's an hour away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 40 minutes I think, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like super duper close.
- It's like 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You may as well go to both. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Kyoto is a fucking nightmare
to get around, though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I will say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know there's ways you can get around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with public transport, but honestly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're going there for a trip, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say just taxi it around
Kyoto. It's super easy to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's a lot cheaper
to get a taxi in Kyoto </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than in Tokyo.
- And you do way more shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because if you just taxi
you from places in Kyoto, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you'll get so much more done. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know that me and Chris did
so many major tourist things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> in that one day.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just 'cause we just taxied everywhere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and did a good route.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the ryokans in Kyoto are amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Obviously super traditional. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you want that
super traditional Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Really good. Brilliant.
- Kiyomizu-dera, all those. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then good thing is again,
Osaka's only 30 minutes away, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Nara, where you can feed the
deers, is only 45 minutes away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can go to the other
side, you can go to Shiga, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> which is near like Biwako, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which is Japan's biggest inland lake. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> That place is really lovely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Kyoto feels like the
iPhone store of Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Everything is so minimal and clean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Kyoto is so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> impeccably clean.
- How do you think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it's gonna be when the country opens up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and we get tourists back? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm scared, because I've
only ever been to Kyoto </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with no tourists.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've been to Kyoto with
tourists and it's hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because the reason I was just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Do we want to talk about
Kyoto?" Is just because like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - People wanna go. I
mean, they're gonna go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> We can't not mention it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - People will want to go obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it is even more probably like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> when tourism, when the
country opens back up, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's going to be even more of
a tourist trap than Tokyo was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> That's what it seems like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Kyoto is extremely popular
with Chinese tourists, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's a lot of
historical stuff there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I went during Chinese
New Year and it was- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh my god.
- Oh my god. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> It was literal shoulder to shoulder. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my god, you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> "I didn't want to eat today, anyway." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> All the stores are full. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because Kyoto,
yeah, it's a cool place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not my vibe when it comes to travel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because it's going
to be so busy, so packed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and you're gonna be lining up
for the fucking 10th temple </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you've seen that day
or something like that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "You know what? Maybe we
can skip this temple." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I go somewhere, I just
want some nice food. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I get it, it's not for everyone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but a lot of people love it, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A lot of people love it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I recommend the places around Kyoto </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more than Kyoto itself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Kyoto is like a good base hub. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've been to Kyoto a few
times in the past two years, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> and I've gotta say, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> my enjoyment of Kyoto
depended on the weather. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah.
- Because Kyoto gets so hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It does.
- And in the summer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's unbearable.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just, I wouldn't even
bother going to Japan... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my god.
- ... In summer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I genuinely, I tell people I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Just don't. Don't come in August. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're not gonna have fun." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Just come between October... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just come.
- Just come. Just come. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just come, come right now.
Who do you want to come? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Come between October and April. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> You will have the best time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would mostly agree with you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> except of the existence of Okinawa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, if you're going to Okinawa, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but how many people are
gonna go to Okinawa? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, not that many.
- A lot of people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Okay. Like, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe if you go to Japan from China. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's the thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because that's where I recommend. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tokyo sucks in the summer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will fully agree with Connor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause if you're gonna go to
Japan to go to just Okinawa, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> then fucking go to a
Southeast Asian country. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so many fucking beaches there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Okinawa is where we go
when we live in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we don't have- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, fuck off. Ah, we colonized
this island, it's ours. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, Okinawa is where- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is where we go if you live in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to get to a good beach, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's not many choices </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to good beaches
here in Japan, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, god forbid mainland
Japan has a good beach. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, there's some in Shimoda and stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, it's-
- Izu has a bunch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know. My standard
of beaches is very high. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I feel Okinawa is the only place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that fits my Australian
standard on beaches. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey was raised in sand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was raised in some of the
best beaches in the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Japan doesn't
have a lot of choices </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to beaches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Funny for an island nation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then again, I'm from England as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we have the exact same problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would argue that Okinawa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is not only great for the beaches, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but kind of very similar to Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where the food that you can
get in Okinawa is next level. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never actually been to Okinawa yet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I can't comment.
- Oh dude, you have to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I've only seen like the spam sushi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okinawa, like spam
sushi is like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more famous one, but like there's so many, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's so many like
traditionalist Okinawa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> and Ryukyu style foods
that are just so good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I mean like the
booze in Okinawa as well, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause like in Hokkaido
you have Sapporo beer. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Right, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which is like, you drink
Sapporo beer in Hokkaido- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sapporo Classic.
- Sapporo Classic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which you can only get in
Hokkaido, for some reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, whereas in Okinawa
there's a specific type of beer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> called an Orion beer, or an Orion beer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> however you wanna pronounce it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Orion beer in Okinawa </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is probably just as nut worthy
as a Sapporo in Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in my opinion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought you said Onion beer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Onion?
- Onion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you cut the onion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cut the onion in half. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cut that. Cut that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So cursed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but Orion, or it's spelled Orion, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's pronounced Orion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Orion.
- Orion beer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like a Okinawa specific beer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and that on a summer day
in Okinawa, is god tier. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. Okay.
- It's so good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And just Okinawa food in general, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you want a different kind
of twist on Japanese food, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can't really get anywhere else, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would definitely
recommend Okinawan food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's plenty of
Okinawa based restaurants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Tokyo as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a really good one
in Ikebukuro, actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Sunshine City, I go to quite a bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you want a different
take on Japanese food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I recommend Okinawan food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, speaking of food, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of people come here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or at least a lot of anime fans come here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expecting to enjoy like the weeb aspect, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then pretty much everyone I talk to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they come to Japan and they're just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I stay for the food."
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The food culture.
- Come for the anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> stay for the food.
- Yeah, yeah. Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Please spend your money
on food, not anime, please. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you're gonna spend
your money on something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know it's going to be hard
walking through Akihabara </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can see some cool anime figures. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Spend your money on a good meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You will not fucking regret it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It'll be the best
meal you've probably had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in your entire life.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> What kind of things do you
guys recommend people try out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> when they're here? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Not Ichiran ramen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Ichiran. Go Ichiran.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Wherever you are, find the filthiest, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> grossest looking ramen place.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Most likely the ramen
will be a 10 out of 10. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes.
- Or a one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's always a ten.
- No, no, it's never a one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's never a one, unless
you go to Ichiran. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The ones that have
the fucking neon signs, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> look really pretty on the outside, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just covering the
fact that their food is mid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and the thing is,
it might look intimidating, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because obviously it
looks very traditional, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you don't know how to order. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Most of the time, there
will be a machine, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a ticket machine.
- Like a ticket machine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all you have to do
is put your money in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and if you're having trouble figuring out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the orders are,
because there's normally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> only four ramens to choose from anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the good places. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, those are the good places. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The less choice you have on the menu, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the better chance it's going to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that it's gonna fucking bomb, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that means that this family, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or the person running the restaurant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has just like-
- Perfected their craft. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They've perfected it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They've sharpened their craft, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. But most of the time
you're only gonna have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three or four ramens to pick from, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can use the fucking
Google translate thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hack that...
- Life hack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Life hack that we use,
if you're having trouble, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's really not that
intimidating at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you just choose your meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe you go with the gyoza as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe you order a beer with it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you just give your
tickets to the ramen guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he'll give you your order.
And that's pretty much it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. and it'll probably
be the best fucking ramen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll ever have in your life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Honestly, like we just said earlier, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conveyor belt sushi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I actually prefer conveyor
belt sushi a lot of the times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the more expensive sushi
chains and sushi restaurants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it depends for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't mind going to
the more expensive ones, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe once or twice a year, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but if I just want like
a consistently good sushi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then, yeah, there's nothing
wrong with conveyor sushi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's a lot of places that
they're just like lunch sets </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> that are 2000 yen, and you
get like a bunch of sushi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's true.
- Made right in front of you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Here's the reason why, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because with conveyor belt sushi, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's such a good value for money, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and I remember the first
time coming to Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and just thinking, the sushi is amazing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it fucking is amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted to stuff myself full </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with as much sushi as I could eat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can't do that
with expensive chains. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's fair. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I prefer the ones with the conveyor belts, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> but you order, and then it
comes out on the conveyor belt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's most places now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's most places.
- Yeah, I know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are still some that
have the rotating ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. Yeah.
- And it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I would rather have the
freshly prepared one, please. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, so with a lot of
conveyor belt brands or places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you go to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll have a system where some of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> will literally be automated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they'll have a plate
that gets shot to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> on a fucking treadmill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the best thing is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's usually shaped like a bullet train. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, so thematically cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's fucking cool. It's
so cool, it's so cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And yeah, to this day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I still eat as much
conveyable as sushi as I can, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I think it's fucking amazing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I love stuffing
myself full with sushi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I can't do that at
more expensive restaurants. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, sushi's good. Sushi's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just fish, rice and wasabi, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fish, rice and wasabi, and... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I also think you should
try the foreign food here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> See what their takes are on foreign foods. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's quite interesting.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - They do some really
good foreign food here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think you'd be surprised. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Italian food, especially. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Italian food's really good here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Some really good burger chains. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's different from
Italian food in Europe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really good though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, imagine that you
know that some restaurants </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> combine the techniques of Italian chefs, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> but use Japanese ingredients, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which can be really impressive. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's maybe not the most authentic thing, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> but you'll get something new,
especially the fish here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god.
- Definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fish dishes in Japan, and Italian food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are like next fucking level. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Definitely. Definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Holy fucking shit.
- The best kind of fusion. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, so good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you think about
them trying wagyu beef? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, try it. Try it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, you know-
- Well, the thing is, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> there's so many different types of wagyu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - When you've lived here long enough, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like you kind of go off wagyu. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- You're like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ah, I kind of want more meat than fat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- But the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> you have it, it is like a, "What
the fuck? This is amazing." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is an explosion in your mouth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Of flavor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's food wars. It's based on like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Eating wagyu, your mouth is just like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where's the best place to get wagyu, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> if you don't know what
you're looking for though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's really hard to say. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, go anywhere in Kobe, I guess, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just get Kobe beef there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Well, let's assume like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Every single prefecture in Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we have our own beef that is just as good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think hida-gyu, in Takayama, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> is probably the best like
type of wagyu I've had. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Kobe beef is like, it's good,
but it's so fatty at times </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're just like, "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno if I'm eating like
a piece of fat or not." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you're just
eating butter, basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, basically. You're
just eating butter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Americans, you'd love
that. You love that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Americans love that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like saying teppanyaki, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you can always get wagyu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Teppanyaki's pretty good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It also just depends on
how it's prepared, as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the times.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But what I really like
about hida-gyu, for example, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that they literally just
put a bunch, cubes of it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> basically just on a stick,
put it on top of a fire, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just put some salt and pepper
on that dish, and boom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the best fucking
food you'll ever have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they sell it as street food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, Chris's favorite
food, yakitori, as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yakitori is good.
- Can't go wrong. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Again, like-
- Can't go wrong. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Do you feel like the
best types of yakitori </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> are the all you can eat
ones, or do you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they should go to a more
traditional yakitori place? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think both are pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think if it's the first
time you're experiencing that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're probably not gonna be
able to taste the difference. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I think the only ones who are like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> only opt to go to say
the more traditional ones </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> are the ones who have just
had so much fucking Torikizoku </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> that they're just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "All right, let me just try and be..." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - If you really wanna try
those kind of places though, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you really need to
learn the names, though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. Yes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because a lot of those
places don't have a menu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - No they don't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Oh yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because you just walk up, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's literally just a counter
and a dude standing there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> just infinitely cooking chicken, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you just have to say the- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just say negima. That's the best one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Negima's the best one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Negima's, hands down, it's
the OG. It's so fucking good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yep, it's just good
chicken with some leek. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, I fucking love leek, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So good.
- Why is leek so good? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The layers dude, they taste so good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And Japan does negi based food so well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh dude, it's so good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. It's really, really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can just plow down on like
50 negimas, dude. I just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Chris always wants the tsukune.
I think tsukune is just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love tsukune.
- Oh, the meatballs? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love it.
- Like why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why bastardize this chicken, dude? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean,
bastardize the chicken? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just rip it apart, and
shove it back together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just grind it apart
and make it into a ball. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's just like, nah, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's the only time I will
accept boneless chicken. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh my fucking god.
- Because it's- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, fucking ground chicken? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> The reason why I don't like it is 'cause </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's almost like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like negima is the perfect
balance between meat and veg. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Right?
- Mm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - You get one bite of
chicken and veg, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- It's perfect. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Tsukune is just pure, just ground meat, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm like, "This is too much." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it more evenly
spreads the seasoning, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's seasoned in
the ground meat, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I just, I kind of
want a variation, you know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well that's the great
thing about yakitori, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Different structure.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> We don't need to argue about this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we can just order our own sticks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Calorific ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> There's ones where it's
meat filled with cheese. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pork belly. I highly
recommend pork belly as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's pork belly
called again in Japanese? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kakuni.
- Kakuni, yeah, that's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kakuni is really good.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] I like kakuni. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, that's the, again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what I order if I
don't want to have something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like wagyu beef, but you still want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that explosion of flavor in your mouth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like that perfect
cube of pork belly and fat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm getting fucking hungry now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, I really like-
- Now that we're just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about this.
- Can I go to Torikizoku </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after this, dude? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm ready to smash down.
- I'm starting to... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm getting hungry. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I've been very hungry this entire episode. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - What would you say then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is the most underrated
Japanese food for people to try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to Japan, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because obviously, everyone knows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> that they're gonna go to a sushi place. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> They're gonna go to an izakaya, but like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The one that no one
ever talks about, unagi. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Unagi's like the boss, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I was gonna say unagi as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, please try unagi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It is expensive. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It is expensive.
- It is expensive. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But it's worth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's an experience. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, because I remember
explaining to my mom </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> how I'm really into unagi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I had to explain to
her that it's eel, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- She's like, "Ugh." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, people can be like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Why'd you like eel?
Well, that's disgusting." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's 'cause her
perception of eating eel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like jellied eels.
- Slimy and... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, okay, yeah.
- I'm just like, "My god. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Living in the UK has to
ruined your perception </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of this fucking S tier food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - So it's like the way it's prepared </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it's grilled and then
it's smoked, I think, as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so it's not slimy,
it's just like kind of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> you know when you grill a
fish and it's kind of like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> nice and crumbly and dry, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then the way they season
and sauce this bad boy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's not dry. That's the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not.
- It's somehow moist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's moist. It's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just flakes apart. It's so good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It has the consistency of fish. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's healthy.
- A perfectly good, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> flavorful, moist fish.
- So good, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You put that on a bed
of rice, really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's some really cheap
places you can get it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'd say the places that
cost around 2 to 3000 yen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> for a box, are probably like the places </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where you'll get some really good ones. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mm.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've gone to places where
they charge 7,000 yen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 70 bucks for just one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've gone to places where
it's a hundred bucks for one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- And it's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's good.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> damn, it's good by like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you tell the difference
in the taste though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So, it's weird, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> With unagi, it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like the subtleness of the flavors </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and especially the fish, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> when you get it cheap, it's so harsh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the flavor of the unagi.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas like the good ones,
the sauce is kind of light. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The eel is just really, oh, I
don't know how to describe it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Fuck, it's... I don't know.
Do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know exactly what you mean. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know what you mean. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know what you mean. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - How would you describe it?
- It's like... I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It kind of like.
- The skin, also, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the texture of the skin
on the cheap places </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is really- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Rough?
- Yeah, rough, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and kind of, it makes you feel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like you're eating something fishy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whereas normally, when it's good unagi, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't remind you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't feel like you're eating fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it feels like you're eating meat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Which is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the weirdest comparison.
- It's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a meaty, fishy kind of... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a meat and fish combo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the best way imaginable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah.
- So good. You have to try. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Do you ever get like
Uber Eats unagi at all? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've had it a bunch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> It's generally meh, I'd say. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gotta go to a restaurant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - But if you're in Japan, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're probably not getting Uber Eats. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Don't waste your time with Uber Eats. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will say that sometimes
that if it's a nice unagi place, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you might have to reserve. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Unagi takes a while to cook.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a lot of places, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if you're
out in the countryside- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially in the summer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Summer, yeah, because it's
a summer food, primarily, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you can get in winter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's still good.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The places in the
countryside outside of Tokyo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally you always
have to call in advance, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and tell them that you're coming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or that you want to book, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it takes, I think, at
least an hour or two to cook. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it's smoked and
stuff, so it takes a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really, really good.
Really, really recommend it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And people don't really talk about it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause people don't like the idea of eels. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- I'm always </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> hyping it up, though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I love it.
- Yep. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I guess for me,
if I can't say unagi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> if you are going to a more
expensive seafood place, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really like uni. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Uni.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sea ocean. Sea ocean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know Connor hates it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Well, uni has like really grown on me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> since I've moved to Japan, like
really, really grown on me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, dude. Fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just like, okay, you know how- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's my favorite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know how they say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you take a sea shell with you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you put your ear against it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> then you can hear the ocean. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- You can hear the sea. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So me, eating uni is like eating the sea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like tasting the sea.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like, if the sea
had poop and you ate it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it would be uni. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the best flavored poop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - If that is sea poop, just-
- Try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess I'm about to-
- Then I'm a shit eater. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - I guess I'm about to play
Euphoria all over again, baby, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I am a sea eating poop lover. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you know what it is,
it's on screen right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's this orange looking paste thingy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> You'll recognize it because
it always stands out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the sushi.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That thing. It looks like it... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> One of these things is not like the other. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's so refreshing.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's so... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'll know which camp you're in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - When you try it, please
let me know, let them know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which one you're in.
- To be fair, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I think out of the almost
maybe 10 to 20 people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've taken to a sushi
place and they've tried uni, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think like 75% of
them ended up liking it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- What? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> most people I think are very
thrown off with how it looks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I spoke to Daidus and
Emily, and they were like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Let's go to a sushi place." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "Sure," </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and they were like, the one
place I don't want to go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is if they have too much uni, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was like, "Don't
worry, I hate uni too." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yes.
- No, it's so good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> No taste. No taste.
- It sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No taste.
- No taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> But no, yeah, I really, really like uni, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and even if you don't like it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I recommend you try it out, because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, try it out.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have.
- It's a very unique flavor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's very refreshing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's nowhere on the same level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as something like fucking
natto, or something like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> where it's like weird foods. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's a very subtle flavor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Subtle?
- I think it's subtle. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like bomb going off in your mouth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No.
- No, it's not. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> What?
- No. It's subtle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] It's like refreshing,
it's like eating the ocean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a salty,
creamy type of nice flavor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that goes down.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so weird, 'cause
you look at a sea urchin, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "How the fuck can anything
edible come out of that?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's disgusting.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the hell is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you crack it open, gold. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Gold of the ocean. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. (grimaces) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I would probably recommend then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what Japan does really fucking well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we think of meat
based foods in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most people are pretty
quick to go, like, wagyu, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think, though, tonkatsu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In Japan. Oh, oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is god tier.
- Fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is fried... No, not
fried, but deep... pork cut. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Pork cutlets.
- Dude, if you ever go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to Gunma, holy shit,
these things are like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They look like they're fighting back. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> These things are thick pieces of pork. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's so good though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's this really good chain in Tokyo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that I love going to, called Maisen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Oh, Maisen, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maisen is god tier. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I took you there, right?
- Yeah, it's so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I took Connor there.
- It's like 40 bucks though, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> but like holy fuck it's worth it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it is the best pork
cutlet you'll ever have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Can we stop recording? I
just got to order some food. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want to go to Maisen, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm so fucking hungry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Me acting. Dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, pork cutlet, there's
nothing that can beat </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a fresh pork cutlet. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - When I'm hungover, it's my go-to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. It's just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Especially when it
has the egg. Fuck, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The texture is just godly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You bite in, and it's all crispy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you get the rich inside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's nice and juicy. Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can have it by itself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or there's another really cool
way to eat it, which I like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> which is katsudon.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which is where you like put it in egg </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and have some onion, and you
put that on a bed of rice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Katsudon is my favorite.
- Yeah, katsudon is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not a fan of katsudon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it's like, to me, part of my... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> one of my favorite things about tonkatsu </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the texture, right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but when you put it
under egg, it just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it gets rid of that crunch to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but that's replaced
with the fucking amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> egg and pork flavor.
- I like the crunch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like the crunch.
- I think the uni </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> turned your brain to goop, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - No, don't. Don't put
them in the same category. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - What are you talking
about, bro? What the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's that crunch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It's that fresh crunch, it's just godly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and by putting egg over it- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - If you get a fresh one, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can get the crunch
with the egg and the sauce </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the onion. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have the katsudon at Maisen, dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it has the crunch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I can't believe you just said that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I tell you what it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't believe you just said that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I tell you what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like putting milk in your cereal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- I prefer it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - You get rid of the texture. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I like that crunch. I
like that fresh crunch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think katsudon is
better than normal katsu, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> because you get the egg, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> the egg and the onions are game
changer, but with the rice, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause when you get the perfect ratio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of meat, egg, rice, and
onions, in one bite, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like food wars level, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - God, I'm so hungry.
- It's the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what Garnt's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt's a little baby, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt's like, dude, Garnt
asks questions like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> "Do you peel your crayons
before you eat it?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Don't trust Garnt, with his opinions. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's a preference thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a preference thing.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me, the best thing about to tonkatsu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is that fucking flavor.
- The preference to eat shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what you do.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, he's got good taste
'cause he likes uni and natto, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
- You wanna side with a guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> who says all bread tastes the same? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> No.
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I will agree uni
and natto is god like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're fucking god like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but again, I would like to argue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there is so much more to Japanese cuisine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than sushi and wagyu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, yeah, go ahead,
eat the sushi and wagyu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And ramen.
- And ramen, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- All fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But if you go out there and try out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some other lesser known stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's like, we only just
fucking scratch the surface. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There is plenty of other stuff as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okonomiyaki. Maybe,
maybe you'll like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh fuck, I fuck with okonomiyaki. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I fuck with okonomiyaki. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, takoyaki as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, it kind of chooses.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Some people really like
it, some people don't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's some really nice
restaurants, actually, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that do it, that are really good price. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mm.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, it's street food, right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but there are some restaurants
that do it amazingly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if you're gonna have
some of the best okonomiyaki </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and takoyaki, especially,
you've gotta go to Osaka. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's true. That's true.
- Like Osaka does the best. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Fuck, the okonomiyaki. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - The best okonomiyaki I had was in Osaka, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in this really shitty
downtown mom and pop shop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course, of course.
- Where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> five people could fit in it,
and it was fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, the thing is, it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like the rule
with Asian food is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you buy it on the streets,
or if it looks fucking dirty, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that food is going to fucking be amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah.
- And that rule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is also consistent in Japan, as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you have the opportunity
to buy street food, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's normally fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've got a question.
What about konbini food? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where does that come into this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Konbini food. Uh... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Konbini food is an experience,
I think, that's really fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the first couple of days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Obviously you're gonna
wanna save some money </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and spend some money on restaurants, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'd say yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've definitely gotta try some. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Konbini food's still great,
compared to everywhere else, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'm trying, I'm like... I'm like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Compared to the rest
of the world, definitely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Compared to the rest of the world, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'm remembering
when I first came to Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, "Damn, I
can live out a 7-Eleven </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> & FamilyMart my entire life."
- I did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I did for a good few
months, and didn't get bored. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You guys lived off konbini
onigiri and sandwiches </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for a good while.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Because compared to the food we have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at fucking Tescos or
whatever, it's like, god tier. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck right off. Fuck right off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm gonna say it, Connor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to say it.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm going to fucking say it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually, okay, listen, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> These sandwiches are good. They're decent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> But these sandwiches
aren't better than the ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> at the Tesco.
- I'm reserving my judgment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I still have yet to try a Tesco meal deal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know for fact you're going to- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know when we go to the UK
for Garnt's wedding, later, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right, I'm gonna try it out,
and I'll see which side I'm on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - But he's pretty scared,
because I know for a fact </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're gonna like the
Tesco meal deal more. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- But comparing Tesco food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fucking konbini
food, it's nowhere near. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's nowhere near.
- Well, the sandwiches... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Okay, first of all, Joey,
here's what I'm gonna tell you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- First of all, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sandwiches actually have crust on them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. That already wins. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - All right, well what do you want? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you want if you
don't want a sandwich? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm not saying... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Okay, I'm just saying the
sandwiches are better. All right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, that's not an argument. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm saying konbini food in general. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What'd you want if you
want a Tesco meal deal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you don't want a sandwich? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Get a salad. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's all right. It's decent. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not going to a konbini
to get a fucking salad, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - A pasty, if you want. A pasty's decent. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a cold pasty, a cold pasty? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Deviled eggs.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Deviled eggs?
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Deviled eggs. You beat deviled eggs? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, it's like a pork ball
with batter, egg in the middle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh god.
- You gonna compare that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> to fucking good fried chicken? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Listen, listen, the
other stuff is better, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but the sandwich game is
absolutely appalling in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I still like them, but the
UK sandwiches are better. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But the sandwich in konbini
section is one tiny section </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> compared to literally the entire- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Also, why's there no meal deal in Japan? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> What's up with that? Why
is there no meal deal? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why is there no drink? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Get your own tea, get a
sandwich and a little snack. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because you have an
infinite amount of choice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> at a konbini.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just called going to
the food section at a konbini. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also, I don't like in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> how it's really hard to get
a normal sized bag of crisps. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, they're all big sized, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you noticed that?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, you can't have-
- You're talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the small ones?
- You can't just have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one portion of crisps, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like you're committing to three bags. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Well to be fair, though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when you do buy the big ones,
though, like 60% of it is air, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> which is probably the equivalent to one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> small size bag of chips. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. But yeah, I mean like, if, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially if you come from England, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think Connor's romanticized
Tesco meal deal is a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Absolutely not.
- Because you got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the sandwiches, and if
you go to a konbini, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you also have sandwiches, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> but you also have the
onigiri fried chicken, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you have some yakatori
sticks, you got bentos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't fuck with the
yakatori sticks at konbinis. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I wouldn't get them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You wouldn't get them? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sticks of fried chicken.
- Well, you get beef balls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You get fried chicken.
- You get beef balls as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - I've had the sausages there before. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Did you get food poisoning from them? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I did not. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I've had the 7-Eleven... not corn dogs, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> the ones like just hot dogs on a stick. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's alright. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - The corn dogs at 7-Eleven
are kind of alright. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, they're all right.
- I've never had one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like corn dogs, though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's hard to fuck up a corn dog. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - If you go to a Ministop,
which you won't see often, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> they have soft serve. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They are the rarest.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, the Ministop soft
serves are godlike. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - They specialize in soft
serve, and it goes hard. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - But Ministops are like
the SSRS of konbinis, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> because I think in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> I think it's only like
0.5% of konbinis in Tokyo </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> are Ministops. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Most of them I feel like
are around Shinjuku, weirdly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah?
- I see a lot in Shinjuku. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I know there's one up
north where I used to live, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that was very rare.
- They're good, though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was very happy I
lived near a Ministop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Oh yes, I've
pulled the SSR. Let's go, baby." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Blimey, there's so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hell yeah.
- You're spoiled for choice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with food, and however
much you want to spend, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can spend.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess we've gotten a lot
of the basic things out the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of your first visit to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What if someone has a
little bit more time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and has been to Japan a few times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where would you guys
recommend that they go to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean, we did
the Shimanami Kaido, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which is on the cycling special. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly...
- Hiroshima. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Setonaikai, that inland
sea area is fucking gorgeous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Beautiful.
- Fucking incredible, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I really, really,
since the cycling special, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I really want to go back there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I really wanna go back there
and do the route again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically, just look
at the cycling special, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just look how beautiful it was, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because the best thing
about it is that you have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all of Hiroshima that's near there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have right next to that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a prefecture called Okayama, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I went there for a video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's this little small
town called Kurashiki, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is this really
cool retro style town. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mm.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just basically just this hill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that overlooks the inland sea, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's so fucking gorgeous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then, if you wanna
cross that inland sea </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and go to Lake Shikoku,
you have places like Ehime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is really kind of down to earth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and kind of chill.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Shikoku's okay. Yeah.
- Shikoku's okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's not much to do.
- It's not the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> exciting thing, but if
you're a little bored of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kochi's all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, if you're a little
bored of the kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whole city life of Tokyo,
and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the main cities,
that's really, really nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and if watching
the cycling special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like intimidated you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't worry, you don't need to
do the entire route in a day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I was to do it again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would definitely not do it in a day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can also rent a car
and just drive across it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can also rent a car, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but if you also wanna keep healthy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> work out those muscles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I do actually highly
recommend the cycling route. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I highly recommend you doing
that in two days, maybe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now that you think back, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what do you think is the optimal
time you would recommend? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would do that in a day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You would still do it in a day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I reckon, if I didn't
want to be hurting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd say at least two days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think it was just annoying
'cause we were filming. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it would've been pretty fun </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if I could just power off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a couple of
the islands in between </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where admittedly, there
isn't a whole lot going on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like the first couple of islands, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's closer to Hiroshima, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there's still a really
cool town vibe to it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's like a lot of
cool beaches there as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> So if you go to summer, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> there's some genuinely nice beaches there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It depends how fit you are, I guess. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you really aren't
fit at all, I wouldn't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, maybe just stick
to the first island. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- But, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're somewhat active </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and you'll have no problem
cycling, then yeah, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd just do it all one day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's very, very beautiful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can also just cycle
around Hiroshima as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, honestly it's some
of the most beautiful views </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've had in Japan.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's saying a lot, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause a lot of Japan
is photogenic as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a bit unfair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I mean, I guess, sticking on that vein, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you wanna go see Mount Fuji, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I do recommend going to one
of the lakes around there. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I can't remember the name exactly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kawaguchiko. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Kawaguchiko. Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> Lake Kawaguchiko is just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you can also cycle around there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can rent a bike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Me and Sydney have gone on a date </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we've rented a bike </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just cycled around the inside lake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of unfair
where you go to a place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything looks Photoshop,
even though it's real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You take a picture there... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> We've taken a bunch of pictures there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno when was the last
time we went there was the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When we went camping, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When we went camping.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Luke took a bunch of pictures, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we took a bunch of pictures, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone took a bunch of pictures, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You get a picture, I get a picture. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - And no matter what, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it was impossible to take a
bad picture at that place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just looked like a postcard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially when it's clear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Which it was when we
went, we got very lucky. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- But, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, I don't know, because I remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when we did the journey
across Japan 2, to Mount Fuji, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of people thought
that by the end of it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we had just green screened
ourselves in front of it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it just looked that good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so weird being in
that place and you just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally feel like I'm
looking at a green screen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or it's, this is a screensaver right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like a desktop wallpaper. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm looking at a screensaver. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm waiting for the
pipes animation to start. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so surreal that a place
can look that photogenic, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but just exist in real life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without any plugins or
any Photoshop edits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No RTX on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> No RTX on.
- We'll say it's probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> one of the places you might
want to drive, though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's kind of annoying to
go by train and stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there isn't a whole lot of train. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd say outside of the major cities, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like Osaka, Tokyo, Sapporo,
and stuff like that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Driving is better off.
- Driving is your best friend. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - You'll have such a hard time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> if you are trying to do
it by public transport, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> as I'm sure Garnt probably is experienced, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you only do it
all by public transport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Actually on that vein, I guess
an app I highly recommend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> is the app that we use, is DiDi, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> which, there is a few taxi apps in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> DiDi.
- Go Taxi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go Taxi.
- There's Go Taxi, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but DiDi is the most, I
guess, foreigner friendly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's you can- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's all English.
- So it's all English. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Accept any card.
- Yeah, it'll accept any card. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> With other apps, it's been really finicky </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the types of cards
that it will accept. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh my god. Japan taxi, and
Go taxi, whatever it is now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my god.
- It is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have a Japanese card,
and it just keeps denying it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I have a Japanese card. It denies it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So annoying. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I have a foreign card, it denies it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I have like cards from Thailand
and the UK, and it's just, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it doesn't want to accept anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It doesn't wanna accept anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I dunno what card it will accept. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So yeah, I highly recommend
DiDi over Uber here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Would you say so? Because Uber- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know you can use Uber if you want to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, you can use Uber, but- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Whatever you're comfortable with. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I think DiDi is, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think there's more taxis on DiDi. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, and it's the best in between, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> because DiDi is not as popular </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as a Japanese app like Go Taxi, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it is still way more friendly if you- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unfortunately, Uber's just
not really a thing here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- Uber Eats is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Uber Eats is, but the
actual Uber service. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know some people
who use it religiously. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But mainly for food, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Also, hailing cabs is
really, really easy here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Especially in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - If you're confident enough </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> in just telling them where to go, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really, really easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Obviously that's a big if. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- I understand it's a tall, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> a tall ask.
- But I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the most part, if you are in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the train system is just so convenient. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You probably-
- Google Maps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - ... very rarely will have to use a taxi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't try to learn the
maps. Just use Google Maps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- It's pretty simple. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It routes it out for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Follow the pretty colors.
- Anyone who says </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they know a better route
is absolutely lying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Google literally knows the best route. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish that people would
shut up being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I know the streets better." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> No, you don't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Google has every fucking
satellite in existence </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and billions of data. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It knows where to go.
- To be fair, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> there has been times where
I've looked at Google </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "Nah, dude, you're
gonna the aesthetic route." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Sometimes, Google wants
to make your life easier </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> to a point where it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Listen, it's just quicker
if I just walk here." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, "No, we were gonna
make it so you don't walk." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, yeah... but
generally, for if you wanna get- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're gonna have to change
three different trains. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you wanna get A to Z, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Google will generally
tell you the best way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you could tell it's to
fewer changes or more changes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mm.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's never failed me in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mm.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even outside of Tokyo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Driving, I use it for driving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> I bought one of those shitty
little things on Amazon </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that you stick on the air fans. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hold my phone.
- Hold your phone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's Gucci, man.
- Yeah, that's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is there any other places
you guys would recommend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a bit out of the box? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've never been to Kyushu.
What do you think, Joey? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Kyushu is great. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think Kyushu is underrated as hell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One place I really, really
liked in Kyushu was Kumamoto. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - The Kumamoto, yeah,
where Aso is, the volcano. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Mount Aso is.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But like, I think
Kumamoto is really cool </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because it's like, it's, again, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this huge like volcanic caldera, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but it's also like, it
weirdly reminds me a lot </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of the kind of plain, open plain places </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that I went to a lot in
Australia and in England </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't look like Japan.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's so weird, but
it's really, really cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you like your kind
of mountainous areas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really dope, and also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're really close to Nagasaki as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is a really dope city. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Nagasaki is a super cool city, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's very vintage feel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It has a very European feel as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because a lot of like European settlers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> came in and out of Nagasaki.
- Ah, okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I don't know. Kyushu,
I think, is really underrated. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> Has some really good food as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've always wanted to go.
- Yeah, it's really cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I still haven't
been to Kyushu as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can go to Oita as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> which has the other
really massive onsen area. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've heard of Oita. And there's Beppu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, Beppu. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Beppu's a really cool onsen place as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gotta fly there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I wouldn't recommend
taking the bullet train. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can take the bullet train to Hakata, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like ten hours, though.
- But it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, seven or eight hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my god.
- From Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't know it was that far. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Very far.
- Yeah, it's very far. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, to Hiroshima, it's
like five hours, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, that's true.
- And it stops a bunch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's not even in Kyushu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I mean I guess one place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I don't really hear
people talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is obviously, if you're a wine lover, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like me and Sydney are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you can go to the wine capital of Japan, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> even though wine's not as well known here. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But I mean, we discovered the place </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> because we're not, I'm not a big sake fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not a massive sake fan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there are plenty of
places to try sake in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and basically anywhere you go into Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you wanna have a little taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of the Japanese wine culture here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's not very well talked about, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you go to Koshu Valley, it's
in the Yamanashi prefecture, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is, you can literally
make it a day trip. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah.
- If you wanted to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just about an hour an
hour and a half out of Tokyo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can literally just go on the JR line </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and go to the stops around Koshu Valley. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> There is one place I do
recommend if you are interested. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I believe the building is
called Budou-kyo, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Budou-kyo.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Grape Hill.
- Yeah, yeah. Grape Hill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's good to do Grape Hill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I believe that's the place, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's the place
I've talked about before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you can go in and
they have a wine cellar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> with about a hundred different wines. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You pay 13 bucks, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you can try as many wines as you like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and that's it.
- It's self pour. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's self pour. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They give you a little cup </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you can try as many wines as you like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> There's little bowls where
you can spit out the wine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you don't like the taste of the wine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Especially if it's just 13
bucks to get munted on wine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I've done it, I've done
it plenty of fucking times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a really, really good experience, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there's a really
nice restaurant up there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where you can see the
entire view of Koshu Valley </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you can see all the grape
farms, and all the grapevines. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mm.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, that's cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That doesn't look like Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's got such a good fucking view </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and me and Sydney go
there for a yearly trip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to try out the different wines there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that come out every year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, you can, I think I drove there, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and there's decent parking. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if you do like saki,
I would recommend Nigata. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Nigata. Ah, yes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Nigata is like the capital of saki, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> and rice fields and stuff. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I went to a similar thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like to the wine thing.
- Vending machines? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Except it was all
sake, for like 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Were there vending machines?
- And you could taste test. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, the vending machine.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's two stations that have it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's basically all around Nigata, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just all really, really
nice sake based stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Chris dragged me to it.
- Yeah, so if you like sake, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> go to Nigata. If you like
wine, go to Yamahashi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - But also, in the
Nigata vending machines, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> there's also umeshu, plum wine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ooh, yeah.
- Really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - They do really good plum wine. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I don't like sake,
so I always go to the umeshu, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like nectar of the gods. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> It's wonderful. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like sugary goodness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, it's so good.
It's very good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so bad for you though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- It's like 100% sugar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Fortunately umeshu is a
bit too sweet for my pallet. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> otherwise I probably would like it more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I couldn't drink it straight, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you mix it with something like soda. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Soda. Oh, god.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, Nigata, I've been there a bunch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> There's not really much to do there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the vending machine is sick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There are ski resorts near it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so in the winter, if you're coming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go to Myoko, which is a
really decent ski resort. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very popular. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And in Tohoku area, in
general, no one really goes to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's pretty chill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been there a ton,
obviously with Chris. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm sure you have as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I love to.
- Tohoku's fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, my family's from Tohoku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Right. I mean, Sendai's chill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yamagata's fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Iwate's fun as well.
- Go visit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> the Abroad in Japan studio, of course. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my god, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Go raid is... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Dox Chris's Abroad in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Morioka is really fun, in Iwate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Morioka's chill.
- Which is above Sendai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Morioka's chill.
- Yeah, that one's really fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fukushima, obviously, is
fun. We've been there a bunch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Fukushima. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. Oh yeah.
- We drifting in Fukushima. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, we went drifting there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A lot of cool areas in the
north that doesn't really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ever get spoken about as
a tourist destination. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think it's because
Tohoku's just so big. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's really big.
- A lot of the biggest... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, I think Iwate is the
second biggest prefecture </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> after Hokkaido.
- It's a cool place, though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really cool place.
- I've had some really amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> food and drink in that area, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's just kind of
nice to go somewhere, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause especially if Kyoto's
too touristy for you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely Tohoku is
not gonna have tourists. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Definitely.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's a good time.
- Way, way chill. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've always had fun with Chris there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially one of the
biggest things about Kyoto </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that it's just too
crowded, and you can get- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's crowded even now, and I don't- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it crowded now?
- It's sort of crowded. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Some seasons I've been, it's been dead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Depends on the day you go, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously weekdays it's dead.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - But on some weekends it's still busy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> So I'm like, god forbid come
here on a peak tourist season. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is there a prefecture or area of Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you've always wanted to go
to, but you haven't been yet? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Kyushu. I've always
wanted to go to Kyushu. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I really still haven't been to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and really wanna go to Aomori. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh I wanna go to Aomori too. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause it's in between
Hokkaido and Morioka. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> why would I not just go
to Hokkaido at that point? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But Aomori has really cool, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like you can do apple picking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Apples. Apples is
what they're famous for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Apples is what they're famous for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Really good food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Really nice Winter
Wonderland places as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've heard it's really fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want to go to Aomori.
- What about theme parks? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never been.
- Huh? You've never been? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm not huge-
- I mean, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you've still been to
Disneyland, though, haven't you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I don't like Disneyland. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm the wrong person to ask. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't like theme parks either, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but USJ is pretty fun, in Osaka. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've been to USJ.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's decent.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you just said you've
not been to any theme parks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> you've literally been to-
- I lied. I lied. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] You've literally been
to two of the biggest ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - The biggest one,
Fuji-Q, I haven't been to, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so I feel like my opinion doesn't count. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, I mean, Fuji-Q
is more like the Six Flags, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> right, it's the thrill seeking theme park. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like thrill rides, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was kind of disappointed by USJ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought there was gonna
be more thrill rides. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why I thought that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you're better off in Fuji-Q. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I figured I'll probably like Fuji-Q more. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I hate thrill rides, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and I went to Fuji-Q and I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, if you love thrill rides,
this is the place to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can go to a rollercoaster
and have a view of Fuji. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How awesome is that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's pretty badass.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where's Thorpe Park with that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What does Thorpe Park have? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What the fuck does Thorpe
Park have? The car park? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well Thorpe Park's good.
What the fuck are you on about? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It is good. It is good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just, like, how can it like... you know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, Fuji is just one of
the best views you can have. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Have you been to Fuji-Q?
- Hmm? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Have you been to Fuji-Q? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've been outside it, and I've- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well great.
- I've driven past it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No shitting on Thorpe
Park. Hold on, Garnt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not shitting on
Thorpe Park, but I mean- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, we all drove past Fuji-Q </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when we went fucking camping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did we?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was fucking asleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't remember that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was just a really
nice, aesthetic area. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. I just like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's good, but you
know, I mean, come on. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It can't be no Thorpe Park. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - No Nemesis Inferno, were you gonna say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's not Alton Towers, though, is it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Alton Towers is so good. We'll take you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't like theme parks, though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, he literally just said
he doesn't like theme parks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I literally just said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't like thrill rides or theme parks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought you were just joking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why the fuck would you not like them? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - USJ Nintendo Land is
the only one I liked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - What?
- But that's obvious, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because I'm a Nintendo sim. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why don't you... what? Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd rather go fucking to
the arcade, or watch a movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is there anything else
you guys want to mention? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Not off the top of my head. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Japan's great. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well that's our starter guide </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> to having a fun time in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Starter guide. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - On your next vacation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Our starter guide two hour podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, obviously we haven't all gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to every single location in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I eventually would like to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to every single prefecture in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's my life goal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, still a lot I haven't been to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It sucks, because a lot
of the stuff I love going to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is just like, yeah, it's
good food, isn't it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Just go to a place for food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, honestly,
like we said earlier, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of the big draw
of going traveling now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is just trying the food
in that prefecture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying the food in that area, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> because fucking, if, like
we said earlier earlier, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the food here is absolutely
amazing, and that's the real... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know, you don't come
here for the anime figures, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't come here for
the fucking temples. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You come here for the amazing food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the real reason to come to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unagi. Katsudon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just go out there and
just try a bunch of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Try everything.
- Try everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - People come here for the
fucking sakura blossoms, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're gonna take a few pictures, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you're gonna have
the amazing food, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's it. That's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The sakura is only amazing to watch at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you're fucking sipping
on some super nice sake, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> eating some really nice food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right?
- Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It all comes back to the food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It all comes back to the food, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I literally revolve my trips in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> around the restaurants and
the food I could try there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - You have to, you have
to. It makes the trip. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It sounds like a joke,
but it's really not. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the highlight of my
trip, a lot of the times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know, if you go to Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and this episode is
somewhat helpful to you, </SPEAKER_01>

you might use it, or years. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> - But you know who especially loves Japan? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> The Patrons.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh.
- Oh, beautiful Patrons. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - They would all love Japan.
- Of course they would. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, they're so good. They're so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because they definitely
don't love anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They love the show, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which means they love Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They watch Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so they definitely don't
watch it because of the anime. </SPEAKER_01>
