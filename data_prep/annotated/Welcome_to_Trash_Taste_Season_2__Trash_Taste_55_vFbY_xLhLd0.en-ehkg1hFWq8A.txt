<SPEAKER_03> - What do you want for Christmas? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You could have five pounds or
a Bible. (cash register dings) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The first person chose the five pounds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The second person asked
for the five pounds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The third person, they chose the Bible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And when they opened the Bible up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was 10 pounds in it.
(cash register dinging) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is the story that gets
people to discover Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "Oh, Lord!"
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (mellow music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hello and welcome to "Trash
Taste" season two guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Woo!
- Yay! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Look at this, new sets. Hello. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You like?
- Yes, hello and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't get a say,
that's our set from now on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, welcome back to
"Trash Taste" season two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm your host for today, Garnt, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and joining me, once again, are the boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I say this, because we've had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like a three week break or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. It's longer than that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like five week break. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it five? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We haven't recorded a
podcast in like five weeks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you guys have had the privilege of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seeing our faces every week, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but we have not talked on camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for a good three, five weeks or so, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- I think it's five weeks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's-
- How long's it been, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It must be at least- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] Since like May 23rd. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, a month.
- Yeah so it's at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> four weeks, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, about a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's taken a long
time to build the set, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot longer than I thought
it was going to take. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You guys have seen like the kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> rough progression of it from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hopefully, the "Trash Taste" vlogs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and also the sneak preview
of the sponsorship segments- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Connor] Oh, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where it's just like a bare
white wall. (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, oh wow, great
upgrade these boys are having. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think everything's
changed except for the TV, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the mics and this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But we're gonna change the
figures as well at some point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah the figures are
eventually gonna be changed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we can film our figure special. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Unfortunately. Japan's
just about opening up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So maybe we'll be able to film that soon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But we figured, what's
one thing that'll make us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really let people know
that we're based in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's grab some Japanese screens. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) That's the
most Japanese you can get. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, are you Japanese? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you live in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's okay, we have a-
- Show me a screen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Japanese guy on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it's not cultural appropriation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I allowed it. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We asked Joey. We were like- (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey, Joey- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, did you ask me permission? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey, is this cultural appropriation? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- I don't know. I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's fine. It's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The kimono episode. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I gave you the J pass,
it's all right. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, good. Good. Good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The J word pass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why do they absorb light
so damn well? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a reason why so
many YouTubers use it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I finally understand - </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why it's in so many sets. So, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Hopefully you guys like our brand new set. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've got new cameras. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We just kind of like, got new lights, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've kind of upgraded
every single aspect- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Behind the scenes, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So hopefully it looks clearer to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Please don't stare at my pores because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) I saw
them on our new cameras. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, this kind
of makes me uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right.
- 4K pores. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now I understand why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> movies stars wear makeup on camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - God, do I have to start
like fucking moisturizing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and taking care of my face now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I already don't like
how I look in 4K, frankly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a certain Evian water spray </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs)
that you might have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> borrow from Meilyne if
you want some nice skin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do miss the 720p days, webcam, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - When your face was just
so blurred and smooth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> My god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could see every
fucking pixel on your face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does Aki make you take
care of your skin, face? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know-
- I do skincare routine now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do, now.
- Who got you into it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Um. What happened
was, when I was doing 4K </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was doing streams, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people were commenting
on my skin a lot more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so it is the upgrade to 4K. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then, yeah, literally
the upgrade to 4K made- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, fuck, everyone's gonna be commenting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on our skin now, I swear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So then I asked a friend, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, I know you're really into skincare." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Obviously a girl. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were, I was like
"Hey, you know stuff, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Tell me which stuff to use."
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They were like, "Say no more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've got like 500 Korean products." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh)
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, "Wait, so there's an order?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I have to do like six things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- But sometimes I forget. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's really long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to put like a face mask on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I use that for like 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Take that off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then put like three
different lotions on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a reason why I grow out a beard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- It's to hide my pores. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have really, really bad bags though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I think that's just very unlucky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I use like an anti-bag serum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I swear it just makes my eyes- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anti-bag serum? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It makes my eyes just go
like this, bro, I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor breathes heavily)
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've got really bad bags as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's genetic, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like, sometimes I
have a good night's sleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Great night's sleep. I
go on camera and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Garnt, are you getting enough sleep? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's going on there?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my god, every fucking time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm like, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Mom, Dad, why'd you have
to give me these genes? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The bags under the eyes is a symbol </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> of how hard the grind for YouTube is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) That's
what I tell my audience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "I'm on the grind, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm an entrepreneur. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sleepless nights, as you can see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, when I do have sleepless nights, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I look like a fucking zombie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs)
And then people are just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, this is a fucking
necromancer right here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But even on my best days, I
still have really bad bags. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I just imagine,
the people who are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Connor, you have bags."
I'm like fuck off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you don't have bags. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you have the most perfect eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you really want me to be perfect? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to be perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't want to have
to deal with that shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm barely tryna keep my
skincare routine in check. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm barely doing anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know if it's doing anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That's what I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've tried doing a skincare routine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I stuck on it for a month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, I'll be honest, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't notice a difference at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or didn't feel too much of a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe felt like a bit of a difference, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know if it
was like a placebo or not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like there are
a lot of businesses made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for our insecurities.
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so, Meilyne came to me,
our producer, you all know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and was like, "Hey Connor,
do you wanna go to this salon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that my friend owns in Japan?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where they do skincare stuff?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then, so I have, like I said before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have hemophilia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I can't have anything
internal bleeding happen to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Generally, I think most
people don't want that too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's normally like a big
no-no. (laughs) (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I literally can't have
anything that even risks it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And so this, one
of the skincare things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like "May cause internal bleeding" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, "Hold up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What skincare going on
here is internal bleeding? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How does something maybe
cause internal bleeding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the first time I
was like "No, no, no"- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - May cause organ failure
but you'll look great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So the first time I was
like, "No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not doing that."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then afterwards they were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You should try it. It's
not really that bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just the whole medical
thing of it might, you know?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "All right,
fine." Fuck it, I guess what- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You did it?
- Yeah, I did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So what it was, it was like electrocution. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like plasma. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As Meilyne laughs, 'cause she's
like, "It's wrong, Connor." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Basically.
- [Meilyne] Plasma shower. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was called a plasma shower, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> which isn't very comforting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds like-
- Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The most horrible punk band- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, so.
- I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds like an old, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> from a League of Legends
character or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's literally like an
electric rod or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that touches your face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think it like strips your skin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really know what it's doing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but when it would touch
me in certain places, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my face would go like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a fuckin' twitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh)
- And I could smell- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally like the
frogs experiment, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It smelt like
burning. (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "What is this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you just get tricked into
doing electroshock therapy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think they burned my face </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I paid a hundred bucks for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they did something
else, which was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was like a vacuum and fluid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it felt really fuckin' weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was like-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And they were doing it on my face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It was going in my ear cavities. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ugh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, how much is skincare worth it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - At this point I was
like, I don't think this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> however good my face looks, I
don't think it's worth this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude. I used to have
horrible acne in high school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So compared to then, I'm taking
this, I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who didn't? Who didn't have
horrible acne in high school? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I had like, mine was so bad that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> did you ever use Proactiv? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, kinda- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like that really famous, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anti-acne thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That says that if you have acne, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just use that for like a month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'll be completely clear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did use it. Didn't do shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It didn't do shit for me.
- Yeah, yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, it didn't do
shit, so then my parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> were like, "All right. I
found a stronger option." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And just tried the stronger options, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing fuckin' worked. So I
had to go to the dermatologist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and literally take drugs for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did it work? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It worked, it worked. I
mean, now my face is clear now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm just like, compared to
that, I'll take these pores. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck I had horrible
acne. I just dealt with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- And then I was just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean you just dealt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, you just let it happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just left it, yeah.
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I also, I think
working at McDonalds didn't help. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The deep fat fryer, I swear, dude, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that shit turned my pepperoni
face into like McGigan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, McDonalds' kitchens-
- Oh my god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are like 95% oil humidity, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That kicked it into overdrive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know when it
went, but early YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you can see I had like fucktons of spots. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Luckily- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You weren't that spotty
when I met you though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, dude. When you watch
this episode go live, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure Moudan's found a picture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of me looking like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a puss fuckin' machine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think you were that
spotty when I met you either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I met you when I was like 21 though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I think, by then,
it started calming down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, when I was
like 19, it was really bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm glad I started a YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> after all of my acne went away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause God, I can't imagine.
- I was fat and I had acne. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause the thing about
skincare routine, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we all care about optimization </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all that kind of shit, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs)
- [Connor] I do. I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's just something
about going my entire life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taking five minutes to
get ready in the morning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then adding a skincare
routine on top of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you quadrupling
that time in the morning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not even quadrupling, you
add like an extra half an hour </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to an hour sometimes, per morning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is it worth this time effort
that I'm putting into? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it making a difference? I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the the other reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted short hair for a long time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just 'cause I was just like, dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like one wipe of the towel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your hair's dry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That shit feels so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> When you get a clean, like a
hair cut and it's quite short </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just, whoosh, dry hair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're like, all right, I'm ready. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's why I
decided to get rid of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my really, really long hair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I had at the
beginning of "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause some mornings I'll
wake up and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Why is my hair still damp?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> From the night before.
That doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, now I just have the
bristle. Like five seconds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your hair moisture should
never be part of your routine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have to like
put in and be aware of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because that's when I know
I need to get a haircut, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I started noticing
that my hair's still wet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I want to do something else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, well I guess
it's time to get a haircut. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's getting way too
much effort to like gel and dry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's why I have a huge respect for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone who has long hair and
has to deal with that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't know, how long did
you have your long hair for? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Way too long. I think I
had it for like six months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe.
- Six months? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It probably went
down to maybe around here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was during the
"Trash Taste" days, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [all] Early "Trash Taste" days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah, once I cut it, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "God, why did I ever have that hair?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so horrible to manage it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially 'cause I had
it in summer as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it was just like a
fucking sauna on my head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I fucking hated it, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck.
- Never again, never again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People miss it, people are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh I want the Jesus hair back." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Yeah, no you don't." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck off, bro.
- No, you don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - How did you guys
figure out, kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when's the first time you figured out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what kind of haircut you wanted? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I went through like
my entire life as a kid- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have they seen your haircut? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just
kind of like didn't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously. Put up the picture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know how to take care of my hair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] The Sasuke haircut?
- [Garnt] Is it obvious? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it obvious? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How the fuck did you
style that shit, man? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was, you know what, the reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I styled my hair like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because it was the hairstyle that took </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the least amount of effort to style. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck off. No- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because when my hair was that short, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like my hair is just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my hair just naturally
spikes up when it's short. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So all I need to do, is get
a bit of gel, put it in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whoop, whoop, whoop. And it's done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's the whoop, whoop, whoop? (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the sound of the
gel mixing with the hair- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whoop, whoop.
- It makes like a whoop- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you did, you would've
blown up way earlier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if you did a how Gigguk
styles his hair video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sayin', you'd have blown
up like a year earlier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How to get a Sasuke
haircut in three seconds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wouldn't have been worth it, 'cause- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - How to get hair that doesn't exist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It wouldn't have been worth it because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it would have been a one
minute video. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Couldn't get the 10
minute ad revenue from that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Step one, gel. Step
two, whoop, whoop, whoop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could have a 10
million view short right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if you did that. Upload
it to Gigguk, right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe I'll make a TikTok. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - YouTube short. YouTube short. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you ever thought
about starting a TikTok? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. I'm already burned
out with all the shit I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't do TikTok. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have respect for people
who start TikToks now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and do content creation and
all that shit on the side. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like I barely have enough time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to fuckin' upload on my main channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. As a kid, I thought
like, old people, parents, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they just don't know how
to use the new technology, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> new social media. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And as I've grown older, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've realized that's not the case at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just, we just don't have
the time to get into them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or learn how they work.
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that's just the end-all, be-all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Your parents could probably
use everything you use. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just don't have the time or energy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to get into something new. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they'd just rather stick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with something comfortable, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. I think I did
open TikTok one time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was gonna make a video on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like actually using it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I got like five
minutes in and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "What the fuck is editing?"
I was so confused. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "I don't like
this. I'm not used to this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm scared of this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe that's how boomers feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, "Ahh, what is this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unfamiliar territory. Delete. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean I could, I'm sure
I could have learned it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if I spared the time, but I
was just like, "Oh, fuck this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it worth it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause it took me this
long to just learn fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTube and Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's like, I feel TikTok's adding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so many extra layers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which I appreciate when
there's a good TikTok meme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because a lot of TikTok I see is shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but when you see a good TikTok meme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's nothing that compares
to the fucking levels of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't even explain it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's so many levels of just
meme and internet culture, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> condensed into such a
short period of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've probably seen
some of the funniest shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come from TikTok.
- Oh, 100% </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was this one, I
don't know if you saw it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was about, this guy was
doing a TikTok with his, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was introducing his girlfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Star Wars Day one! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey And Garnt] Oh, yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Today's my birthday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm going to introduce
to you my girlfriend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it's literally like
the whole hostage situation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then they just add,
an extra layer just keeps </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> getting added, every time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it just goes so far beyond
what you thought it would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I just think it was fucking genius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh it's genius, so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When TikTok's like that,
I fucking love TikTok. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything else, I'm an absolute boomer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to TikTok. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause what I will say is
that, the content algorithm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on TikTok seems to be so
far beyond other platforms, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's so easy to find
content that suits your tastes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whereas, I don't know,
with YouTube now, it's just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube seems to be going
through a transition period, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it doesn't really know
what it wants to recommend you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Should it recommend you
shorts or long videos? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't know any more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the internet is
kind of switching around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's also 'cause YouTube's
just tryna compete with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> literally every other
social media out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So when they added like the whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Instagram Stories replica as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even know what
those were fuckin' called. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were like. There was that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the Community posts
is literally just Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Remember when stories were just Snapchat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then Instagram had Stories </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then Twitter had stories, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then YouTube has stories. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everything has stories now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everything has stories. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate the stories on
Twitter. I hate them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Fleets, you mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Fleets.
- The Fleets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking think they're so garbage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used it once and I was
like, "All right, I hate it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm never using that again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never look at my friends' ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I never post any. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, get that shit outta here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's taking up real estate
on my app. I don't want it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's another
shitpost I could be seeing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's that amount of space
that's covered up by Fleets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like, do I really
need my tweets to delete? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not really that into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think they need to be deleted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just save it for- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I already have old tweets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> delete automatically
from my thing, anyway so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It makes it completely obsolete. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who wants them to be
deleted in 24 hours? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause no one's looking at it anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it was a tweet that
got deleted in 24 hours, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I could kind of understand
what that would be useful for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like if I'm posting, I'm
going live on my Twitch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Delete it in six hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is it in a completely
different section, I don't wanna- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Have you seen the
Twitter live streams as well? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, yeah. And then also
Twitter just copied Clubhouse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with essentially the whole app </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just put it in Twitter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which I think it actually suits more, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but I don't use it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that what that is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I keep getting
notifications of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> certain artists I follow being like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Starting a Space or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they're starting a Space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's just, again I don't use it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like, "What the fuck is this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. I hate it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know what it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And some people who I like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm a big lurker online, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And some people are who I
was following started this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, Space thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I joined it and it was like,
"Gigguk has joined the room." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Fuck!". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get that shit, no,
they don't need to know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's horrible. No
lurking for you. (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just, I don't know
if I'm the boomer here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I just don't like some
of the new features they add, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't figure out if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just being unreceptive
to the new thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or it's actually terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I don't know anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause sometimes things- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it me that changed
or is it the children? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because sometimes it
turns out to be really good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But then it's just not integrated
well enough in the start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm not really into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I remember I was like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with Instagram Stories, as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when it first started. I
was like, what is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Deletes in 24 hours? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck's the point
of this? (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And now I'm just like, all right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> finna upload to my story, let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now I think Stories
are better than posts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, now I think Stories are great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, maybe, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe I'm just a fucking
boomer, I don't know, whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's probably the boomer kind of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably a boomer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's probably a 24
year old boomer thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What can I say? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, you know how we, we're
officially boomers now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because we've held a press event. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's how we know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we have. With
actual, probably, boomers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that have been on the same stage as us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel bad calling them boomers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like really
important people. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like legitimate government people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh, fucking hell! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck! Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. We say boomers, but
actual official, like political, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> important people have
been on the stage, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you can just tell, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you guys went on to the FCCJ channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which a lot of you guys did, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think we had like
4,000 people watching us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when normally I think they have like six. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. A lot of the comments
were really confused. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like, "What is this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Can somebody explain what happened?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think we were also
really confused as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I guess we can
explain what happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. What is the FCCJ, Connor? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Foreign Correspondents
Club of Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Correct.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which I believe is just
essentially the foreign press. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's like an organization </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the foreign press in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And a guy reached out to us, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who was the interviewer. Called Fred. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was like, "Hey guys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm writing an article
about YouTubers in Japan." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Foreign Youtubers, talking
about, like depicting Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And I thought, to be fair,
that's a pretty good article. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I mean, I feel like
most of the younger generation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are probably getting a lot of
the information about Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from us or Chris or you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know I got way more of
it from that than the guides, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because most of the guides are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, you should check out the
Kiyomizu-Dero Temple in Kyoto </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then go," you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's super generic, but no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to see someone do
something really fuckin' unique. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, he asked us a
question about, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> travel guides, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just, when he
asked me that question, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just thought, who reads
travel guides anymore? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no.
- Boomers. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah. You say that,
but even my parents now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They've gone, they were
like, "Oh, I've watched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this fellow called Abroad in Japan." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, "Oh, fuck off." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh god, of course you have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn it.
- Of course you have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And even a lot of these travel guides </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cite people like Abroad in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Which is really funny now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now it's just, instead of
actually finding their own shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like "Chris found this
really fuckin' cool thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Go check it out."
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Japan YouTuber Chris Broad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, anyway, so he reached out to us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he showed us the article
and it looked really legit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was gonna be in Number 1 Shimbun- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ichiban Shimbun, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's called.
- Yeah. A news- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is a paper here in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. And, as we all know,
we all need, we need a bit more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> official backing, 'cause
two of us here are verified </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on Twitter.
- Fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And one isn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And the reason I got verified is because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had submitted the articles
that were written about me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the interviews that I've done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, obviously, someone
here hadn't had any articles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> written about him yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But now we've got an article
about "Trash Taste", so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have articles, I
just didn't submit them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I submitted my Wikipedia, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> which wasn't good enough
for Twitter verification. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course, because, what was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The day that you found out
you guys had a Wikipedia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you uploaded pictures for each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. We uploaded pictures. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We spent literally like half
an hour of this "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recording-
- Because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just trying to update these guys' Wikis. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, somebody had
made a Wikipedia page. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's very meticulous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was very grateful
for it, but I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> why didn't they upload a picture? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like this is very
easy. Just upload a picture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then it got removed
anyway because we- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was like, "They're
legitimate looking pictures." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're our pictures. What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean we added
each other's pictures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then like less than 12
hours later it was gone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Connor laughing)
And I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck the system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you get a picture
on Twitter, Instagram, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wikipedia? Fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And yeah, so they reached out to us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was like, "Hey, do
you wanna come and give a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> record a pseudo-podcast
on this YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we checked it out, and
we were like, "Wow." (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, some heavy
topics on this channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think the week he sent it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was something like
"LGBT rights in Japan". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, well that's
pretty serious stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you want us to
come on and just clown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then ask us about pizza fucking crust? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can tell that the
"Trash Taste" viewers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> had invaded the chat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we were having this
very official press conference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I get asked about
pizza crusts and anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, literally the first question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like "All right we
got some questions from the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> audience right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the first question here is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Garnt, what do you think
about pizza crust?"" (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just find it funny how just
utterly unprepared they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> for the amount of questions
there were gonna be sent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I remember, the
person running it just came up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with a huge stack of questions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And the interviewer looked
at this, being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is more questions than
I've ever seen in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is going on right now?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like 20 pieces of paper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like, here's the questions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And the guy's like, "What?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fuck? What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was quiet fun though, I mean it was- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- A cool experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we were like, I
remember the guy was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, it's on an official thing,
FCCJ is a professional thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that does a lot of press
conferences and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you guys can just come casually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, you know, we're
just gonna do it casually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like you guys do on the podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we were like, "We're wearing suits." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bet. Bet.
- Bet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> We're wearin' the suits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nah, I mean, there was that
wall of the previous people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that had done FCCJ press conferences, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they've only started
live broadcasting them recently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If I understand correctly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But they've been doing them
for like years and years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Most of them have been private. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we saw the Dalai Lama on there. I saw- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hayao Miyazaki was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hayao Miyazaki. Did I
see Trump on there as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Trump. Donald Trump.
- Trump was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A very young Trump was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, fuckin'- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You said the President
of Thailand had done it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the ex Prime Minister of Thailand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know this, 'cause
I saw a picture there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "He looks kinda familiar." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Where
do I recognize him from?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I snap it, send the picture
to my mom and she was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh that's the ex Prime
Minister of Thailand." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus.
- So I'm just like, "Fuckin'"- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, only the important people frankly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Fuckin' brilliant".
What's going on 'ere? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then, imagine that wall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the literal
front of the FCCJ building </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is this giant billboard that says like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Tonight on FCCJ: "Trash Taste"". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was so fucking weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause we should not
belong on this billboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I think, as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the journalist Fred, was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I want it just to be like a
normal "Trash Taste" episode." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "I don't
think we can do a normal"- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not-
- No. No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not how it works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think we can just
turn up here and just do a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> normal "Trash", I think I'm
gonna have to be polite." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was he expecting us
to rock up and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oi, dickhead. What's going on?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I saw a lot of
the comments be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is the most calmest and most polite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've ever seen the boys." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you'd seen the stage that we were on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd probably act the
same as well, honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you knew who was on
this stage before us then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would probably act like that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughs) I saw a comment
that really made me laugh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like, "The water
man's doing God's work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not a glass empty for a single second." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so awkward, as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause we were just
sittin' there and this guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just creeps over with water, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like bent over and I'm like,
"Oh, I feel so bad for him." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "I don't need water." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I was like, "Why
are you topping me up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm basically full." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Also, Joey, why did you
have to go to the toilet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mid-sentence?
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You couldn't have waited
until you finished speaking? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was hilarious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I deadass was holding onto
that shit for dear life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You could have done it before
you started the sentence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For like thirty minutes.
- After you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started the sentence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I was like, "I'm gonna
go for as long as I can." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think about an hour into
it, 'cause it was a two hour, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think, live thing.
- Yeah, it was two hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - About an hour and 10 in,
I was like, "I'm gonna die." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My bladder is about to explode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why not before you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I can hold on, it's like 50 minutes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I just concentrate on
talking and just listening, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can get through it.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, I got, I forgot what,
what question did I get? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You were actually getting asked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a serious question about Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you were in the
middle of a serious question, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you were just like, "Da-da-da-da. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry can I go to the toilet?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Didn't even finish your, you just went. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Joey, what the fuck?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I literally got mental whiplash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was like, "Oh, this
is Joey being prim and proper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and professional." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) Then out of
nowhere, he just busts out the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Can I go to the toilet?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can hear the very
moment my heart just snaps, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like "You have to go." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was just like, "I'm
gonna cut this sentence short. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to fucking go, otherwise
I'm about to piss onstage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of 4000 people." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll be honest, when you
asked to go the toilet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I looked at you and I'm
just like, "Should I do it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Should I do it?"
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "No. No. Hold! Hold! Hold!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, I looked
at you guys and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "I can't be the only one
who's busting for a piss." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like Garnt should be dying right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was dying, inside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> My leg was like going
at fuckin' sonic speed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like, "Come on. Come on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I was like,
"Water boy, if you come near me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one more time and fill up that glass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to kill you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't need. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I have stopped drinking water
for the past 30 minutes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause if I drink one more sip of water, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I am going to explode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Stop filling up my glass." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could've just been like,
"Can you hand me the bottle? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Could you hand me?
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Just give me the bottle boss man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just drink it and then
slowly bring the glass down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "This is gonna be a
really weird question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But can you get under the table?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nah. I couldn't man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Do I just ask the question </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or do I piss onstage?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Imma ask the question." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs)
Fuck it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He said, he was like,
"Yeah this is the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's ever happened in
the history of the FCCJ" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "Bullshit!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's gotta be another
Asian person who has a bladder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just as small as mine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure. Surely there's
someone else out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> has a small bladder like us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I take his word for it, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think you made a, you
ruined a press conference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or I made history. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> By being the only person- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a lot of people
who've made history </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's not this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of people have
made history on the FCCJ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but no one's ever taken a piss
break in the middle of one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gotta ask. What did you
guys write in the guest book? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember, so we had
to sign a guest book, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So every guest who's been
on there has to sign it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and write some kind of
message or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we had some really like
deep, important messages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, some talking about some very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hot political topics right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some people, I think one message
I saw said something like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "We must listen to the
voice of the people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The people will not go unheard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's only so long that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we can stop listening to them." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or something along those lines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I turn the page
and it's just my message </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, "(speaks in foreign
language) Gigguk, 2021." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least you came up
with a kind of funny one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw that and I was
like, "I can't top that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? What did you write? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I wrote something
like "I like anime. Yes I do." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
- Only the biggest of brains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that the same thought
process you went through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when you came up with The Anime Man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah, literally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mr. Worldwide.
- I like anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I like anime. Yes I do.
- I like Anime. Yes I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Joey "The Anime Man" Bizinger, 2021. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just put, "I don't
know what I'm doing here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's literally all I wrote. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's probably the most honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's probably the most honest one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "I don't know
what I'm doing here. Connor." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Connor. Not even your
full name. Just Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, just Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "I don't know
what I'm doing here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nah, but it was a great experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It was super weird to be
on something that official. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't even think our
fans knew how official it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they were watching. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, we didn't even
say anything about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> until ten minutes before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We were like, "Should we
tweet out that we're doing it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's being live-streamed. We may as well." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And now it's the most
viewed video on their channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> as well.
- Ayy. Let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think, probably by the
time this video is live, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it has well over a half 1,000,000 views. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's pretty-
- Which is pretty insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it was basically just
like a "Trash Taste" episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but just polite.
- Polite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Polite.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The gentlemen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did like all the
memes which were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh damn. POG to the new studio set." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn. That's where all the budget went. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's where all the budget went. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it wasn't a "Trash Taste" episode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was the Garbage Taste episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember, I saw their
camera and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Weak. What a weak
camera." One camera angle? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs)
- One camera angle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is this, a SONY
hand-held? What is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on, get a real one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Manual zoom-in. What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Where's the
lights? Where's the lights here? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on." Look at this.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - They were like, "This floor
has a restaurant in it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You guys can afford a restaurant,
but not a good camera? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Seriously? Come on. Come on. Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kidding. I'm kidding,
it was very nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we were really
honored to be invited on that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we realized much, I think
it kinda set in much later. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Oh, I think
we actually did something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty cool and legit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I think it's, I don't
know how many YouTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can say they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> done something like that.
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think we did a good job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We didn't embarrass ourselves too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. I'd say so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say we were, I mean, we
were way more reserved than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> on our usual fuckin'
monkey-mode podcast, whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, yeah, it was a great experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And one of the things we've been doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in between building the sets, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Among many other things.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What else have you guys been up to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nothing.
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Building this office has
taken so goddamn long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's taken a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You guys will get the full scope of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the "After Dark" vlog, which I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the time this goes up might be up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe.
- Maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We still haven't finished
the "After Dark" set yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, we still gotta
build that too, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're still building the
"After Dark" set but we, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first time
ever, I think we're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one week behind our actual
"Trash Taste" episodes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the closest we've gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> from actually catching up to our backlog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think we've only been like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the very beginning of
"Trash Taste", by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Trash Taste" episode one, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, literally, so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well no, actually, I
think, I can't remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I know we always have a buffer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and this is definitely the
closest we've ever gotten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to losing that buffer,
but I mean, the reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why we have a buffer anyway
is so that if we miss a week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or we need to do something,
it's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we don't really talk
about current events </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And our audience gets
that whenever we do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> talk about current events. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's very, very outdated
by the time it comes out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like three weeks later.
- Yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So, E3? I'm joking.
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, hi. Didn't see you there. Hi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's me, Monke, from "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll be doing the ad reads
for today's episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And this first one is from
a personal favorite of mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ExpressVPN! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Watching Netflix while
not using ExpressVPN </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like paying for a gym membership </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and only using the treadmill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a waste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ExpressVPN does a big brain move </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and lets you change your
location to anywhere in the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so that your internet thinks
you're in another country. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it has over 100 servers in
multiple different countries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're like me and want to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other countries' content,
ExpressVPN is perfect for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I miss the BBC. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't take that out of context. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I just want to watch
my home TV programming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but sadly you can only watch it in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But thanks to ExpressVPN, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's no longer a problem anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I barely notice that it's always on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's super easy to use. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just takes one click </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're connected to a server. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's seamless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it works on my phone, tablet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fridge probably, and my PC. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And don't forget that it encrypts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all of your data carefully. So
what are you doin'? You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You're paying full price </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for all these streaming content websites </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can't get the full library. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't forget to use our link down below, </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> And you shall receive three
months extra for free, </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> So don't forget to use our

<SPEAKER_03> to get three months
for free of ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you had yet another
crazy taxi experience, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't you, Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did, I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll send a, oh I wish I
could send you the picture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the route I took, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'll do a fake drawing of it for this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause if I show you actually the route, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll know where, ah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'll know where
our studio is. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kinda just doxing where we live. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'll know where our studio
is and where I go to school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) So I'm not gonna do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, essentially, this guy
took what should have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a ten minute journey
and did it 45 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So, what's up with that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, I mean. This is the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, what happened was is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this wasn't a miscommunication
fault or anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I didn't tell him where to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The app tells him where to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I was using a
ride sharing app, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, literally when he
picks me up, he has to say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, okay. This is where I pick him up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is where I'm going." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, when he says he's picked me up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it will tell him, on
the thing, where to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I got in the car and I saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it was telling him
to turn and do all that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was where I'd told him to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, for some reason, this
guy just, he ignored the turn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Okay. Whatever." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> He probably knows a better route, right?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe he knows, 'cause
he was like 80 or 90. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Very, very, very old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "He knows the
streets better than the maps, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so then he misses the next turning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, "All
right. Okay. All right." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Misses the next turning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Okay, this
is getting a little weird." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Must be some local route. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm like. And then
he misses another turning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And this is getting to the point
where I'm like, "All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This man is just straight
up going the wrong way." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So I ask him, in terrible
Japanese, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Where are you going?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And he said somewhere in Roppongi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is totally not where I was going. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally the opposite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The opposite way of where I was going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "No, no,
no. Don't go that way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Go the other way." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he was like, "What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> What? Where do you wanna go?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I told him.
- "I can't hear you, what?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I told him where I wanted
to go and he was like, "What?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I show him the app and he was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, let me put my glasses on." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "You're driving
without your glasses on?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't read this and you're driving? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "They do this every time." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Every time I, (grunts). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This annoys me to death
about Taxi drivers here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Every time I show them
on my phone where to go, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they have to put glasses on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "If you can't read." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why are you driving? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why are you driving
without these glasses on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is this, blurs? Or is this like Ozu? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Tryna like? What are you doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And no wonder you can't see
the fuckin' navigation system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, yeah. He completely
goes the wrong way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I eventually get to figure out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to explain to him where I wanna go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was just 'cause
there was some weird thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the address that I put in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it wasn't quite what I said it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But even though the address in
the thing was still correct. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But I had to then reconfirm to him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was going to the place
where it told him to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is like, why do you even ask me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't talk me. Just take
me where I wanna go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you sure you wanna go
to the place you specified? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is what I don't get.
I told you where I wanna go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Maybe you can confirm?"
and I said, "Yes." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What? What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm losing my mind, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the thing is racking
up to be pretty expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause this is like a 45 minute journey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's pretty fuckin' expensive.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially in Tokyo, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you know, the
journey I was gonna take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just 10 minutes and
it was supposed to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 10, 15 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Not a big deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It turned into like a 45, $50 ride. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Hold the fuck up." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And also, after I eventually
told him where to go, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was pretty stressed
out, I was like, "Argh." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was trying to watch YouTube videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was looking at my phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then suddenly, the
guys just emergency stops. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, my fuckin' bag goes flying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my water bottle goes flying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Yo, what the fuck?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is like the best bit! (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughs) And yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Listen, I don't
if you're going for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> worst taxi speedrun any% here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) I don't
know what you're tryna do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You are literally fucking
everything up here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's deadass like a "GTA" player. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. He nearly crashed the taxi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was unfortunate
'cause I couldn't see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it was his fault or not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It looked like it wasn't his fault. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I didn't blame him that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it was also just kind of annoying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man's just out here
playing "Crazy Taxi". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah he was literally
playing "Crazy Taxi", bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, immediately, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after this, as well, I think
because he was panicked, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because he'd taken me wildly off route, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he'd nearly crashed the car. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He wildly fucked up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He pretty much fucked up everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a taxi driver could fuck up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So he started speeding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get me to where I needed to go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I did not feel comfortable
with this man speeding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after he just nearly
crashed the fuckin' taxi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) So I was like,
I asked him, I asked him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Can you go a little," in Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can you go a little slower?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he panically
turned his full head around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, no, no, no, no, no." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hold on, I gotta put my glasses on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to check the speedometer. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Normally, I normally am
fully accepting of the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that kind of turn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, yeah. Okay, got you, got you". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like, "Wait, what did you say?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "No, no, no." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> He's going like 80 on a 50 road. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Stop. No, no, no." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not gonna say anything,
I'm not gonna say anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, I was like, "This
is the worst fucking taxi ride </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of my goddamn life." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so, every taxi driver
in Japan has their full </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> company information and name
and everything on the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I took a picture of
it and my phone has the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in Japan every phone has to make a noise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you take a picture, it shutters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There is a ch-ch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So my phone did that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I think he heard it, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So anyway, he finally
got to me where I was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One piece. I had to check myself
when I got out of the car. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Am I alive? Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And as I was getting out, he
slowly pulls his wallet out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Are you tryna bribe me?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To not complain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that even legal?
- I don't know if it's legal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably not legal.
- Probably not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably not. I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He didn't tell me, "Don't say anything." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think he was tryna pay the difference, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of what he went over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it worked out to be
around what he went over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the fee should've been like $15. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like 40. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So he gave me like 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Fine." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what, I don't want
to complain to your company. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) I don't
want to have to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I wanted to get my
money back from the company, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was like, "This
is fuckin' terrible." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if that's me being a Karen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think that I don't
want to get ripped off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. I mean- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think it's a Karen to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I almost died. Can I have money back?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I, dude, I hate, I do not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I will never ever complain
about someone who is doing a job </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you don't make much money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'm just like, I don't feel like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think you get
paid enough to warrant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you losing some money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, if I have problems
at fast food places, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll never, I'll just be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You know what? It wasn't
great. I'll keep it to myself." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll deal with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I might leave not a great review. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But I won't be super harsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're not gonna be like,
"Where's the manager?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the British way to do things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just, again I don't
want to make someone's life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> more difficult than it is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life is fuckin' hard enough as it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But, there is a certain
point where I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You have done such an awful
job where I think it's okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me to want my money back." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well yeah, of course. Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like taxi's understandable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause your life is in their
hands, as well. (coughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And literally, everything was terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was just gonna complain to the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not to his company first, I
was gonna complain to the app, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to see if I, 'cause the
app can normally just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he'll still get paid, I believe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they'll just refund me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is what I wanted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because fuck the
multi-conglomerate company. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But instead, he just took out
the middle-man and was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Here."
- Yeah, instead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he paid me 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Sure."
So I gave him five stars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's like, "I don't speak any English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But you speak this language, right?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs)
- Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "You know what I'm sayin'.
You know what I'm sayin'." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, "You know
what? The man's hustling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> All right. Fine. Fine. Fine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally bribed a five
star Uber review from you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh)
- I was like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The man knew he fucked up big time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he wanted to try and fix it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I respect it. I'm down." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna go through this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't wanna go through this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's just walk away from this happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you speak the ones and zeroes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, 'cause all I wanted
was the difference back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm happy to pay the taxi fee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just don't wanna be
charged like 30, $40 extra </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I don't need to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not like a fuckin', </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not a cheap guy.
- I get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just don't wanna be ripped off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like taxi drivers
here are very aware of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Because most people in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially in the service industry, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are fuckin' super nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - They don't rip you off.
They don't rip you off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They do not rip you off
at all, 'cause I remember, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I had to take a pretty long
taxi that went via the highway, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but there was really bad
traffic there on that day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so, it took like, I think
like 20 minutes longer than </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they journey shoulda taken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the taxi driver, he
told me that he was gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stop the meter early because he feels bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they were stuck
in traffic for so long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even though they went via the highway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm just like, "Damn, man that's"- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not even his fault. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's not even your fault. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You're a real one, man. You're a real one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, when you taxi,
you're just gamble, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause maybe the highways are congested, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the risk you take. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just part of the risk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like just
taxi drivers, or anyone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so weird to me that
you can't tip people here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause out of every country
that I've lived in and been to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one country I've wanted
to tip people the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is here in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just, it feels bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've gotten some of
the best service I ever have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anywhere in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I can't pay them a bit
more to show my appreciation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the only service
in Japan that you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> actually tip people is Uber Eats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But that's just because
it's integrated in the app. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's just 'cause it's Uber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah Uber Eats is Uber, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Uber Eats, which is an
international company, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I always tip if it's raining. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I always do, yeah. 100%. 100%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel so bad for them when I order food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it's raining. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They turn up at the door
fuckin' soaked. I'm like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially when it's
typhoon season as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just like, "Damn, man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "$3 okay?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - "$3 for your troubles, sir." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my god. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't know. It's just, oh fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It was such an awful
experience, it was just like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I felt so bad, 'cause I was in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was tryna optimize
it, so I ordered food, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like lunch, to arrive at the studio. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> For when I was gonna get
there and then I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Joey, can you get my Uber Eats?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, 'cause I was waiting at the studio </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Connor was like, "Yeah
I'm 10 minutes away." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Cool." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll see him very soon then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like 30 minutes pass, and
I'm like, "Where is he?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Connor laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I saw that on the message stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I wasn't there
at the studio that day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Why
is Connor telling Joey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to get his food?"
- Can you get my food? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This white boy getting
more privileged every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Joey, I don't wanna deal
with the Uber Eats man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please get my." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - "I can't speak Japanese,
can you get my food for me?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You're the (speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey, so you can do it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus Christ, man. Fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why I'm always
scared, man, to get on taxis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it's like, again, in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 85% of the time, they're
over the age of 70. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just don't know what to expect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes they're the
most pristine, proper, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuckin' Batman's assistant
levels of amazing driving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then, sometimes you get
people like that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Where it's like, you shouldn't
be behind a steering wheel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I had a guy one time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got in the car. Started
speaking fluent English to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Wow." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
- Really? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Wow." He's like, "Are you
comfortable with the AC?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "What?
What did you just say?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - In like a really velvety voice? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The man sounded like PSY,
from "Gangnam Style". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was he old? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah. No, he looked like 30. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Wow. Wow. Wow." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well that's like an extra
star point, right there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are you doin' being a taxi driver? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I was so confused. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just so caught off-guard by it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Yeah. Yeah. It's
great. It's great. Wow. Wow." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause normally they don't
ask you anything in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Normally if someone's
below the age of 60, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you rarely see someone below
the age of 60 be a taxi driver, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> especially here in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. I'll just give you a life hack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for if you ever come
to Japan and use taxis. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're only ever gonna
ask you two things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Where you're going. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And do you want to use the highway? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that'll always be the second question. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just say yes. Just always say yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't say no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, so once you've told them
where you're going, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Even if you don't understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck they're saying, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So once they've figured
out where you're going, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about like five minutes into your drive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they'll turn around and ask you something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And just say yes.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they're gonna ask
you about the highway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just a Japan
life hack, in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If I don't understand what
someone's saying, I just say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just say, (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You'll remember this. If you
come to Japan, remember this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> He's gonna ask you
something two minutes in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five minutes into the taxi drive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> He's gonna be in the middle
of driving. Just say yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's asking if you
wanna go on the highway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just say yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Someone probably could've
asked me if I could be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like an accomplice in a murder </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I've said yes to it, in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Probably don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I've just said yes to everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The only time I know, I
actually have to pay attention, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is when there's like, "What,
are you sure about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you know, did you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> press agree on terms and conditions? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know what you just agreed to?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they do like a
fuckin' "Millionaire" thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like, "Final answer?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) "Final answer?
Are you sure it's a yes?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Oh, oh, oh,
can you repeat that?" Oh shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then even when they repeat that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "Yeah?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause on the signs in
Japan, on the highways, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it just says "Expressway". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I just assumed, they
call it expressway too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's not called expressway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They call it, what is it?
(speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey, Connor and Garnt
speak in foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That's what I said. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is direct translation
for "High, fast road." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah, well.
- So there you go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I was also told that
they understand "highway". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I was confused, so
I never said "Highway", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it always says "Expressway." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I never said highway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But they'll understand if you say highway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, highway, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Second life hack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you don't know a Japanese word, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> say it in (speaks in foreign
language), then- (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, really.
- And then- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It'll feel racist, but it's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so if you don't
know, if you can't read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (speaks in foreign
language), just say it in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most racist Japanese
accent you can think of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they will maybe
understand you, sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah dude, sometimes,
when I'm streaming in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I have to say a word
like that, people Pepe laugh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Connor just said it a funny accent." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "No. That-
- That's literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how they say it.
- They won't understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> unless I do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love how all these
people, yeah, because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyday words have just become </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> more and more English now, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause say, like "Spicy",
right? Do you want spicy food? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "No, the
Japanese word for it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (speaks in foreign language)." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I've always said that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can also just say spicy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. Oh, you can?
- Oh, you can? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I like that. I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Didn't know that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like "sexy"? It's just "sexy." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Milk"? It's just "milk." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause I learnt, what was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A recent Japanese word, oh cafe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is like (speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (speaks in foreign language)
is the proper Japanese word. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Or you can just say coffee.
- But everyone just says </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cafe here. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause your grandma will say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> My grandma will say (speaks
in foreign language) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but everyone else will just say coffee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything's becoming English, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so I've realized, actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the place that I am now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's more easier just
to say yes to everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if you don't fully understand it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I remember me and Connor
had another taxi experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, no! This guy fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which was-
- drove me up the wall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which was on my birthday night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So after we hung out we
went back to Meilyne's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and we went back to my house pretty late. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we all live in the same area </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so me and Connor got a taxi back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we were, this was at like 5:00 AM, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were very drunk and very tired </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so, Connor orders a taxi via DiDi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is kinda like Uber. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So the address is already
in the taxi, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Again, he knows where we're going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He knows where we're going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It literally tells
him a pinpoint location </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where to go and how to get there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So we get in the taxi and he asks us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, where do you want to go?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I didn't know that he
already had the address </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he did already have the address </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was in his system, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I tell him, "Please go
to this address," right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I think you said
the station near our house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I think that's when he got confused. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause then now he's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now he's like, "Wait is it
the station or the address?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And bear in mind, they're literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> two minutes away from each other, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I'm like, "Just go there
and it'll be all right, buddy." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Both of the addresses are
in the exact same place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just go there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I think then he
started getting really like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's like, "Wait, which one though?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then every five minutes,
this man would turn around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and ask, "Which one are going?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, "Here? Here? Here?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were like, "Yes. Yes." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was trying to explain to him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's near the station. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's near the station." Right, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's just like, "But
it's a different address, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where do you want me to go?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Just go to the," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my Japanese wasn't good enough to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Go to this exact address." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, "Just go near the station </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and we'll direct you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like, (heavy breathing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Am I going the right way? Am I?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do these taxi drivers
not have freedom of choice? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally the same road. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not even remotely far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a computer
tryna run two programs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at the same time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Which one do I
open first? I don't know." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I literally gave, he was like an AI </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just gave him a logic bomb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's how he acted and I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just thought to myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is not on the taxi driver, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause obviously it was
just a language barrier, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I just thought to myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I should've just said
(speaks in foreign language)." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughs) I should've just said yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And just said, "Yes,
please go to the address." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You didn't use the life hack, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, we did say (speaks
in foreign language) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like seven times in a row. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he still did keep
asking and I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah because he probably asked, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Do you want to go the station?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You're like (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Or did you want to go to the house?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, (heavy breathing)
"Which one though?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We used the life hack, but. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also, everything we said to him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> he was clearly, he was quite old </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and his hearing was clearly not great, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause everything we said
we had to repeat but louder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I feel like some things
we said pretty fuckin' loud. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> He didn't understand. And
I was like, "I'm done." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or maybe that was just your, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe in your guys'
drunk mind you were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it reality it was like, (gibberish). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was very, very sober at this point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was just tryna sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he kept waking us up, and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm fightin' for my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just to get five minutes
of sleep here, buddy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sydney was sitting next to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> She doesn't remember any of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She was passed the fuck out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god. This is like,
Sydney kept making it worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause Sydney was drunk and kept going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (speaks in foreign
language), saying things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we were like, "Sydney
shut up. Literally shut up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're confusing the man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughs) I completely forgot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She literally kept making it worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was literally about to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Garnt, tell her to shut,
get Sydney to shut up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I swear to God." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause she was clearly not even awake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and she'd be like, (speaks
in foreign language). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we're like, "We're not
even there. Not even there." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> She would say like, "Oh, here's fine." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or like, "Keep going." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And we're like nowhere near. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she'd be like, "Here's fine." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> No. Sydney, Sydney,
Sydney. Please. Please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughs) She was dream
Japanese talking in her sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, it was,
I was like, "No! No!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I found it impressive, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it was like she
was speaking Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was off enough that it made no sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in the context that we were in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it made enough sense that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone would say it in a
taxi, right? So. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All the correct things
you would say in a taxi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember, I'd keep
going like, "Sydney, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Please. Please, Sydney.
Please stop. Sydney, stop." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah but we eventually
got home after what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it felt like, two hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So wait, did he drop
you off at the station </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or you house?
- Yeah he did, he did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He dropped us off at the station. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay, okay.
- I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He finally came up with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't even want to try
to direct him to my house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just stop. Just let me
out. Let me out, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fair enough.
- Let me out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get me out of here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't stand this.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I mean, that's
part of the reason why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're looking to move, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have we talked about how
we are looking to move? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause we've-
- Yeah you've talked about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> moving, right?
- I've moved already, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, a month ago now, at this rate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm currently in the process of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've applied for a
place, just hoping I get, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I find out this week,
so just praying I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think doing the whole
moving process again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has reminded me how much
of a nightmare it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first time, to get a place here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just didn't
realize, or I'd forgotten, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I had everything set up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I'm going through the
process again, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Damn, it was a nightmare." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'd completely forgotten about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's equal parts exciting
and equal parts just dread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So far, it's not been too bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's been really annoying being rejected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for really petty reasons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's been quite annoying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's, I feel like
I'm so used to that now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I'm like, "I'm not
the right nationality? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, cool. See ya."
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Fist bump. "Later, dude." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm kinda used to it but, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, how many places
have you been rejected from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so far, just one, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, two, two, two.
- Oh, two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But some of them were not rejections </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I didn't apply but
some of them were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh no, no. No foreigners." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah, just straight up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So is that like a
rejection? Do you count that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's a rejection, I'd say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause that's like, I feel like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like 10, 15 then, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Half of them are gone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Half of the whole Japanese housing market </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just unavailable to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd say it's like even more than half. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even if you have the money
to pay for this house, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you just can't get it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> for whatever reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think we talked about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've talked about
this a lot. Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Episode two or something,
where were talking about how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's fuckin' impossible for
foreigners to rent in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also, I feel like this
happens everywhere though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to kind of like
decide what's important to you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and you have to make sacrifices
depending on, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even if you have unlimited
budget, there's not gonna be, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you wanna get a house in certain areas, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just not possible in Central Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah. I mean, unless you're actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> buying the property, you
don't have to do that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The thing is, when I'm
looking at houses now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first question I ask is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Has anyone else applied for this yet?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And if the answer's yes, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well, that's pretty
much my chances gone." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Soa didn't tell me this,
but if someone asks to apply, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the odds of you getting it are super low. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's normally just
first come, first served. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if the person before you is Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're probably not gonna get rejected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unless they're like super sketch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So if, yeah, like you said,
they took me to see places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and half of them would
already been applied for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "What am I doing here?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What, so you can and of
course, the two places- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Check out this place
you probably won't get. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So the first place they took
me to visit was five houses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the two that I really, really liked, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of course, were the two
that had applications. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, "Great. So
now I've fallen in love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with two places and I
can't fuckin' have them." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) It's like a literal cock-tease. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is! It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So now you've shown
me what my standards are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you've taken them away from me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "This is what you could have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if you had a Japanese passport." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so then, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, well I don't like the other three, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so can we find new ones?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We found new ones,
didn't like any of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Well this sucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause now I don't like any
of these fucking things." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And eventually, found a
few that I kinda liked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've applied for
one, that I quite like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe neighbors might be
an issue, we'll find out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm just gonna soundproof the room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before I move anything in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well again, that's a sacrifice
you have to take, really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's pretty fuckin' hard.
I mean, I think the one- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna have neighbors, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The one sacrifice I took with my place is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just slightly kind of out of the way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially when you go into Tokyo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But everything else is, fuckin' love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a great house.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I'm just
planning to put soundproof panels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the wall, and I'm just gonna
put that on the side walls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and the roof and the carpet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you got your first
noise complaint, didn't you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did get a noise complaint, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - After all this time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know. I was definitely
pushing, to be fair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think 'cause when I first moved in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wouldn't even walk at
full speed around the house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'd heard how careful I had to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I realized,
oh, nothing's happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, so I start walking normally, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you kept testing the limit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Slowly keep pushing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then the "Apex" stream
starts getting later and later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The "Apex" at 2:00 AM streams did the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pushed it over the limit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what it was that did it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because when I go the complaint, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hadn't done any late night streams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I would say were loud. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd only done one and it
was a very, very quiet one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know it was, 'cause
I was actually talking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wonder what did it, 'cause
there was some where I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> full-on shouting at 2:00 AM. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I didn't get it. So I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, we go a noise
complaint at our place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But a week-
- It was the speedrun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but a week after the
actual event that had happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm just like, "Why am I
getting the complaint now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after a week?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think 'cause it goes to the agency </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the agency tells you, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the agency has my
number on speed dial. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So they could easily have just
called me the next morning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and been like, "Ah were
you loud last night?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they could have been
like, "We've got a snitch, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kinda cringe." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Connor laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, because I
was so confused, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "We got you, bro. Don't worry about it" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, legit, I was like, "Who said it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Who?" I was literally like
Liam Neeson from "Taken". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Who sent you?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, they won't tell you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I understand, privacy reasons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But also, I'd like to know so that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can kind of maybe put
some stuff on that wall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. 'Cause
if I know who it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at least tell me, 'cause they
didn't even tell if it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone from the same building. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Tell me who's a little bitch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I can soundproof that sound." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because if I knew it was, say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the neighbors downstairs,
then I could be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, okay. Maybe I should do
some padding on the floor." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get a thick-ass carpet.
- Or a thick-ass carpet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something to avoid it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Or if it's people across the
road, well then it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well I can't do fucking
anything about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Meilyne, just say hi.
- Meilyne, what is this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the FCCJ?
- Go on, go on, go on Meilyne. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You've gotta be water- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Gotta shake his (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Water boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I knew who the
neighbor was then I could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> take precautions and work so
that I don't have to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I always understand that
if it was me complaining </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I probably wouldn't want
to be named but also, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you could maybe- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't need to know
the specific person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just need to know is
it a neighbor below me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it someone across the road? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it in this building? I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess they're worried
that you might go to him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, "Yo. Open the fuck, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> why you complaining, little bitch? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) Why you
complaining? Why you such a-" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Say it to my face, motherfucker!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then also, you could be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey man, can I ask you when
you need me to be quiet?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, is there stuff goin, 'cause </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if my neighbors, dude, they can shout </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all they fuckin' want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But if I was, if I had a kid or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> then maybe I'd be like, "Hey,
keep it down after 10:00. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Shout in the day. I don't give a fuck." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the problem,
'cause if that was me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was getting noise complaints </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from, say, someone from upstairs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd just fucking go up
to them and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, I'm not gonna snitch
on you or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can we just talk it
out so that we can come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to some kind of mutual agreement?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But, in Japan, no one fuckin' does that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They're just like, "Ring,
ring. Help me please." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I asked, I asked,
like "What can they do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What can they do with this complaint? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What happens?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They can technically get you evicted, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if they tried really freaking hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Especially if you're a foreigner. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I mean, from my last place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that woman downstairs tried to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, "How-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Until I (speaks in foreign
language) her. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, "How fuckin'
hard to do they have to try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get me evicted, then?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it like, "How much effort
do they have to go through?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think they said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "A lot of work and it
probably wouldn't happen." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm just like, "Well.
I'm not that bad." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not shouting all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I have turned my volume
down during streams. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At least you're not doing
construction at like 2:00 AM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think they'll
kick you out or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just fuckin' get the
drill out, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like "Shawshank"-
- Who's gonna complain now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (imitates drilling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Shawshank Redemption" in this shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> waiting for the lightening to strike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (imitates hammering) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, I think I've done like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they clearly don't care during the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I've done voice
lines during the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I'm full on screaming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like full on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No they don't care during
the day. It's only at night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I bet some neighbors
do care during the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like-
- I mean, I think- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The pompous neighbors,
they're like, "Oh, god, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm uncomfortable at 2:00 PM." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe on the week-
- "YouTuber? What is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Voice actor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> God, I just thought someone
was getting murdered up there." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The agent, who was finding
me my apartment was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I watched your YouTube." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't tell her my YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But they had to know my company. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. Of course.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so I think she just
went on the company's site, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> saw my name, she watched
my YouTube videos." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Oh, God." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just got "Are You YouTuber"-ed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Are You YouTuber?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was like, "Oh, cool.
Which one did you watch?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And she was like, "Oh I
watched you drinking alcohol." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, with
Chris, and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of all the videos.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What a terrible introduction to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is what I do for a
job. I get sloshed on camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Gonna think I'm a serial- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So this was, you filmed
this in your house? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> She was like, "So do you film
all the videos in your house?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Ahhh."
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "It's very
rarely. It's very rarely." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got a studio, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, I film a lot
outside. Rarely film indoors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, honestly, I'm
barely talking, frankly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, that's how I got my place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I literally had to tell the
people who I was applying it to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't tell them anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause they, the
person who owns my place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watched my YouTube, 'cause
they had to know as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was applying under my company. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they were like, "So are all
your videos filmed inside?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, "No, no, no.
Most of these are outside." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like, "Okay. Okay. Okay." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be fair, I never record
past like, 5, 6:00 PM. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just streams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Which again, I mean, it's
not much better, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember, you said before, in London, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you used to record like 2:00 AM or 3:00AM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - My neighbors didn't give a fuck though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, then again, they
were blasting "Peppa Pig" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through the wall at 2:00
AM, so I don't really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laugh)
- "Pepper Pig". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What kid is watching
"Peppa Pig" at 2:00 AM? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "Mom, put on the
episode. This one's a banger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Turn it up, Mom, turn it up."
- Turn it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if it's like-
- It's my favorite OP. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't if it was 'cause I
was in a kinda not great area </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of London, I don't if there's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a mutual understanding of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "No complaints. No police. No police." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because my neighbors had like
10 people living in a house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that had like two bedrooms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I dunno know how much
police they wanted over there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why, I'm pretty sure,
they never ever said anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause one time, multiple times actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I opened the door to
get a package from them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it looked like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like so many fucking
people were living in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Ooh. See ya." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was very weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I think that's why
they never complained. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And also, the walls are
thicker. That's what I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever had a neighbor from hell? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or like a bad neighbor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan aside? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - In England?
- No. I've been pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think you did, you
mentioned in on "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did I?
- The really loud sex, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, no, not that. That
was actually a fine- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that was pleasurable? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was a fine- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I enjoyed hearing their
sex through the wall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was a fine neighbor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's my homie, right there. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We high fived. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We had a mutual understanding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They could have sex in the next room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I could record
podcasts whenever I want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and be a YouTuber.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was great. They didn't complain at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I didn't complain, in turn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But did you have a neighbor from hell? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I did actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never do, fingers crossed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> _ Yeah, it was the actually the place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had moved to after that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was actually the first
place I moved into with Sydney. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we just had this guy living above us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And we didn't know this when we moved in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we moved into this house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was basically like a HMO, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so a house of multi-occupancy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like basically a
house that has been like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cut up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's been cut up to have
several people living in it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So the walls, we didn't realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how thin the walls were, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we had a guy living above us that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> he was old, he was an older gentleman, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and definitely had few
screws loose, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause he said that he used
to work for the police, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he would bring this up constantly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because in this house that we were in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they had heavy fire doors, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we'd have to really be super careful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we were closing the doors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's letting the doors go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's also like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because these doors were so heavy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you'd just have to yank it in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And sometimes that yank
was just a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> too much power behind it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it would just make a loudish noise. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so this guy living above us, he was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at the beginning he tried
to be a nice neighbor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we tried to be nice neighbors as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then we soon came to realize that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this guy had massive anger issues. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm pretty sure, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one day he could be the nicest guy ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the next day he would just blow up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the smallest reasons
and we were just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yo, we kinda don't feel safe." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Every time we'd maybe shut
the door a bit too loudly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at first he'd tell us, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Be like, "Please shut
the door a bit quieter." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we're like, "Sorry. That was our bad." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We knew about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so we'd be extra, extra careful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, you know, when you
go in and out your house </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty often, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And sometimes you just yank it a bit loud, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a bit more harder than you would, sorry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you yank it a bit
harder than you intended to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So one time, he told
us to be careful, fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Nothing happened for a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, at around 7:00
PM, I just yanked it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "Oh, shit.
That was a bit loud." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Literally comes downstairs, fuckin' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (heavy footsteps thumping) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What the fuck did I tell you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He literally full on fucking screamed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Yo, what the fuck is going on?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And from that moment on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> keep in mind this was a
month after the last time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd accidentally shut it a bit too loudly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Yo, Sydney,
I'm thinking we're living </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> below a crazy guy here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, at 7:00 PM, who gives a fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and it was 7:00 PM, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't even in the dead of night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - "What the fuck did I tell
you a month ago?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so, I don't do the Japanese thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I go up to him and knock
on his door and like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yo, bro, let's talk it out. Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's come to an understanding here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And so we talk it out and he's
very polite and very calm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, fuck.
- That's how they get you man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's very calm about it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're just like, "Look. Look, mate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the first place we've moved to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with my new girlfriend." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just, "Sometimes walls are
very thin, so just keep in mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm right below you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "No, I totally get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> After 10:00 PM, that's
when we're super quiet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We'd normally go to sleep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I gotta work the next day as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you know, sometimes we're
not even talking at a loud </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of volume or whatever, so
as long as you can understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that we are a couple and we talk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as people do when someone
else's in the house, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then we'll try to keep
it down at late hours." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I go back downstairs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally a week later. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not even closing the door this time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm literally just having a
normal volumed conversation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with Sydney and instead of shouting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he starts walking around really loudly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Starts smashing down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the floor.
(footsteps thundering) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're like, "What the fuck is going on?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Me and Sydney, we're like,
"What the fuck is going on?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I go back upstairs and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Is everything okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you having a stroke, a heart attack? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's going on?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, "Look. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're being fucking loud </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just wanted to
teach you a lesson, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> This is what you get for speaking loudly." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, "What
the fuck is going on?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this has literally
scarred me for life, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I was living in fear that this guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was gonna do something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause over time, 'cause we lived here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a year and a half, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and obviously our relationship
deteriorated. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As it would when I've
felt in fucking danger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> living in my own house
and Sydney felt in danger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> living in our house, as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so it got to the point where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some days we'd just be talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he'd just randomly start banging </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on his fridge doors or his cupboard doors, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> making a lot of noise when he thought that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were making a lot of noise. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we were just talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and having a normal
conversation most of the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And eventually it went from
the, the relationship went </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from me trying to talk it out with him, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to being like, "Dude, what
the fuck is your issue?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, "Bra, I
used to work in the police. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't fuck with me, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If I wanted, I'd call them over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd get all my mates,
I'd get the boys over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'd get you out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Just say the word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just don't fuck with me." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, "Fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney, we gotta move
out as soon as possible." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This was one of the big
reasons why we moved out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so on the last night
where we moved out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney was already gone
'cause she had gone back home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to America, so it was just
me and a mate talking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so it was me and a mate talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were watching a movie, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we weren't even talking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just the volume of
the TV at that point, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we get this bang on
the fuckin' door, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this guy starts screaming, full volume </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my face, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's just like, "I know
you're about to fucking leave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm fuckin', I'm glad
you're about to fuckin' leave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I need to give you one last
piece of my mind. Fuck you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You've been the worst fucking
neighbor of my entire life." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus.
- And then he starts going off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about how he's part of the police again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Bro, calm the fuck down." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At this point, this is
probably the most pissed off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Dude."
- Monkman went out the window. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no. I'm just
like, "Dude, back the fuck off." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he looks at me, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He looks at me straight in the eye. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, "Go on. Have
a swipe. Have a swipe." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) "Go on. Go on."
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I knew he wanted
me to throw a punch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so he had a reason to call the police. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I straight up tell him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I straight up look him
in the eye and tell him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Dude, you don't know who
you're dealing with here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was a fuckin' monk,
I'm not gonna punch you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "I'm fuckin'
zen right now, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can try as hard as you
like, I'm not gonna punch you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he gets closer and he's
like, "Go on. It's easy. Go on." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Dude, just back
the fuck off now please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna re-enter my home,
please just fuck off." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's so sad. What a sad guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that was the last I heard of him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was my neighbor from hell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really hope that no one ever
goes through that because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did you, how did you stay in there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a year and a half, dude? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause our contract.
- Oh, yeah, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally, it was hell
because anytime that we wanted, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we hated being in
that house, eventually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> After about six months to a year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we just stayed at my parents
house as much as we could. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then eventually we just
straight up just moved back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to our parents' house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it was like a fuckin'
hell living in that house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's kinda why I never want to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why I hate apartment sharing now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that one experience
has taught me just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just want my own space. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I want no one to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a noise complaint
actually triggers me now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I'm just like, "Ohh. Fuck that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, dude. I don't fuckin'
blame you after that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And yeah, I'd completely
forgotten about that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until we started talking about neighbors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, there you go.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Digging up old traumas.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Only on "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, what an asshole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right? What a cunt. Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure he's happy.
I'm sure he's happy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure he's happy now.
- I'm sure, yeah I'm sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he's happy now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I think the early
signs were there because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure that he won't
get a neighbor who's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better than you, anyway.
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure he's probably
dealing with people who are- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yean, no, 'cause there were
early signs that were there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because he was telling me
about the dude that lived </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in that place before was
also a "young person" as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he would not stop complaining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about how much noise he made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how loudly he shut the door. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "I mean, I've
shut the door. It's loud. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's not like fuckin'
shake the house loud." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd probably just get to
the point where I'd just start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> making noise to piss him off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> He can swing and smack
on my door all day, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've got the SONY WX thingies, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm noise-canceled, bro.
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's what noise-canceling
headphones were made for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure, what are you gonna
do, break into my house? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's this apartment
made out of, paper? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think so, man. I dunno. I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause what, in the UK, what is it, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 10:00 PM is the official time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you're not allowed to make noise? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, so right before 10:00 PM, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd probably just blast music non-stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then when 10:00 PM hits, turn it off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then rinse and repeat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, what's the worst they can do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I was just trying
to be a nice neighbor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it's before a certain time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think the noise pollution
is below a certain decibel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think they can't do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They actually, I don't
think they can do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like legally, they can't do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I could be wrong on that.
I don't think they can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> As long as it's within
a reasonable amount. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's just the arsehole
tax that you pay them? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well you can just start
ignoring him, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) Maybe
he'll take a swing at you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe. Maybe, you know
what I shoulda done, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just gotten some nice
noise-canceling headphones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you should've bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, just, if he knocks
on the door, who cares, bro? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs)
Sleep through it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's he gonna do? Break down your door? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like nah, bro.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just Kool-Aid Man's
here, "You're too loud!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then you can call
the police. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You can see his friends. If he has any. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can see the boys, I can see the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If he actually has any. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That he's talking about, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This your mans? This
your mans, right here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - People who brag about
that kinda stuff normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't have as strong ties
as they make it out to be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, they don't, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I mean, I feel like he was an ex-cop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a reason, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) He's not a current cop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I've never really
had bad housemates, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I've just had housemates
that didn't pay bills. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But there's ways of being
able to get them to pay bills. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I think that's why- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean I would argue a housemate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that doesn't pay the bill
is a bad housemate. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I would argue that as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would you? I'd rather, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because, right, what we
would, what I would do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was in charge of the internet, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was the only one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause these guys, I
mean they were my age, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they didn't, they weren't very- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Knowledgeable? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - About like, yeah, about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> technology and internet stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they didn't realize
that if you had the password </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the internet you could log in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and turn off the internet
to certain devices. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you know you could do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you can just type in the, what is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Whatever the numbers are,
the 19, whatever 182, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you can log in.
- The IP address? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the IP address, you'd log into it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you could just turn off
devices, so I would just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if they didn't pay me,
I would just turn off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all their internet for all their devices. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I would-
- That's literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the equivalent of your mom
taking your Switch away </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you didn't do your chores. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "Until you do your chores. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> No more playtime for you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and then they would be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, Connor, I've got an assignment." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Why didn't you pay me?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Pay me and I'll put your
internet back on." And you- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a power move, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah, 'cause I'm like,
"They're not gonna pay me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they were being
assholes, so I was like, "Well." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, rightfully deserved, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "You haven't paid for
me like half a month now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're all students, I don't have money." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is, you know, I'm paying
a bill for four people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't pay me like 10 quid, come on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, that's why I
hated being in charge of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're in university,
were you the guy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm guessing you were the guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in charge of paying the rent, then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or was it just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, so the rent was
actually done separately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But the bills were done through me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was only in the second
house that I had a problem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The last house, there
was only three of us, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they were all really chill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they all paid, whenever I asked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the house before that,
they just never paid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they were just
spending it all on weed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (laughs) As they do. As they do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As they do.
- Yeah, yeah, so I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well, I mean, all right, well fuck." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah 'cause you always have
one housemate in uni that just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was never there and
never paid for anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you'd have to fucking
hire a private investigator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something to get this guy's money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or get the money from that guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was weird, man, 'cause
one of my housemates, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he was like, what, how old
are you in second year? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like 20? Barely 20, 19? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 21, maybe, 20, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - He had a, his girlfriend was pregnant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then he had the baby, and
it was just all so surreal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I'm here, barely
have my life in order </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this man just brings his
fuckin' child into the room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, and then I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "What goin' on, this is so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't like this."
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I felt bad
asking for internet money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Hey, by the way,
can you pay the bills?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - "I know you have to
feed your kid, but, ah." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, "I'm sure you
can go a week without weed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just pay me, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And give your kid some
Starburst or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know."
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Just pay me, I don't know." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - "I've got some top ramen left over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you can give it to your baby."
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And also, I think his girlfriend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> basically lived at our house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, "Should
she be paying some bills? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, to be fair-
- Is it weird? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should, but.
- I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm not gonna ask but I think you should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just pay me on time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we've got no problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So annoying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it just wouldn't
get done, unless I did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We wouldn't have internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Well, I want internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm gonna do it.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna set it up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, and inadvertently
it's in my name, fuck." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well maybe it was better though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it was inadvertently
in your name, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, well 'cause then I
canceled it all, I did it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And all that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think one time they didn't pay me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for the last month, and because they left, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just straight up refused to pay me. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> Mack Weldon, reinventing men's basics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We just went for a pee break. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> As I was saying, right before we left, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that house, the one where
they didn't pay the bills, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they actually owed us, I
think it was something like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 80 pounds in the end, in overdue bills. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And because we'd all left the house, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't hound them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I messaged them on Facebook </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they wouldn't send it to
us. And so, I had to pay it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was actually me and my friend, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were the only ones who paid bills </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we were really, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were really close and
I still hang out with him, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still message him sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Really good friends with him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we both basically paid all our bills </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sorted it all out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah, so we had to then
pay the bills for two months, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the other guys who didn't pay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were really annoyed about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we were trying to get them to pay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they weren't paying us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, I felt like some
cosmic justice was given because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The gods smiled down on you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The gods were like, "Hold up, Connor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it turns out, right, we'd
actually overpaid our bills </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we got a rebate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so they'd actually given us money back, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which was actually more
than what we actually owed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we ended up, given like 50 pounds back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And my friend was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Should we give it
equally between us all?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Do you think they
would have done the same?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Let's just split it 50-50." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, "How about, fuck 'em." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's 25 quid. Let's just keep it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's just go to the
pub. 'Cause fuck this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hell yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They weren't gonna pay us. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I bet if you messaged
them, they would've replied </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at the speed of light. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probs.
- They'd have been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Here's my PayPal, by the way." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Oh hi, I'm just gonna send you money." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, yo. No worries. No
worries, come at me, fam." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pub? Pub? Pub? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, I do feel a
little bit bad about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even before we record, I'm
like "Can I tell this story?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, fuck that, dude.
- "It's like me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> am I stealing here?"
- I would've done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They would've done the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They would've done the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't have been sorry about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially if they
didn't pay you, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they literally
wouldn't reply to our messages </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about paying us back.
- Ah, fuck that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I felt bad, but I was also like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'd just would never
ever steal, but I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If they're not gonna follow the rules, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then why should you
follow the rules, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, I agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel it's fair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I guess so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I feel like
going through rent drama </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or some kind of like
bills drama in university </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just like a rite of passage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like everyone's
had at least one person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that they've been living with
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who has just been like the
most difficult dickhead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to fuckin' get any kind of money out of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just feel bad 'cause I feel
like I'm better than that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right.
- I don't do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I wake up in a cold sweat, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What's that the statute of
limitations of stealing?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, 'cause even
though it's a small amount, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well, I felt bad, but I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You know what? No. Fuck them." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But also, it's literally like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good kid does one bad thing and is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, shit. Is the police gonna come?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh)
You know what I mean? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's called karma, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> litters once, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh shit. Am I going to prison?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, I just never
did that, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it was very, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it was very validating
but it was also like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Fuck. Am I gonna go to jail?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "What's the limit to stealing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> before the cops get
called on me?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like one week and I'm good, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm free? I'm free? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you ever stolen anything? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. Never. Never. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Even as a kid.
- Even like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Hello, this is "Trash
Taste" criminal records." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, me neither. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, guys what's the most
illegal thing you've done? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, me neither. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You know how, in the UK
you can get, what was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's like bakeries in the store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you have to tell, on
the thing, what you got? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think one time I got a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like four croissants and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I clicked what I thought was four, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went through and then I came, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went to the till and I paid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Turned out, boys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I chose the wrong croissants,
right? On the machine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Big sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it was actually
cheaper than what it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, damn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I felt-
- You absolute criminal scum- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know, I know, so I left the store. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got about like ten
seconds out of the store </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and I looked at the
receipt and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "This is not, this is not the." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I actually got I
think the chocolate ones, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, "This is
not the chocolate ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is 20p extra."
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I went back and I was like, "Hi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do I need to change,
like pay the difference?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the guy was like, "I don't care. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like 20, I don't think they care." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) And
I was like, "Are you sure? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't mind paying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel bad that I walked
out with 20 pence, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the wrong, uh, you're not
gonna call the cops, right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But he was like, "Dude
it's, what, no one cares." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had that before, I did the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know when you're really, really young </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you do the accidental stealing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The completely unaware stealing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I did that once, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I was like fuckin' I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> five or six years old </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and in Australia there's
like newspaper stores </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where people go to buy
newspapers, magazines </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and usually at the front cashier, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's all these really
small, cheap candies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and chocolates and stuff like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that kids can buy and whatnot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I specifically remember
there was one time I went, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I think my dad had to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go buy a newspaper or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> back when he was still buying newspapers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And I picked out a candy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was like 10 cents or 20 cents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Dad, can I have this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was like, "Bugger off,
son. You're not having that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And "We got sweets at home." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember, I don't
know why, but that day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess I was in a pissed
off mood or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember being really
angry that he didn't buy me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this 10, 20 cent fuckin'
pissy little candy, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember just being like, "Ah, man." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just clenching my fists, being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Goddamn it. Why? Goddamn
it father, why can't you"- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna steal right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no. I was like-
- I'm about to steal. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I was just like, "God damn it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Just clenching my fists really hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then we walk out and
we're walking to the car </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm still pissed
off, clenching my fists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I kinda look
down at one of my fists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I open my hand and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've done that before.
- The candy's in my hand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like,
slowly put it in my pocket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did that get here? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I was like,
"Something feels weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in my clenched fist."
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, at that
moment, it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fuckin' "Detroit: Become
Human" choice just popped up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like, "Do I put this in my pocket </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or do I come out clean?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, put it in my pocket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Imma save this for later." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what I did try
and do one time and it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, so, you know how like corner stores, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't really have the super, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ultra-advanced labeling,
price labeling thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just kinda have those
little cheap plastic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> paper stickers on the,
like the orange ones? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They would put like a pound or 50 pence, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and one time I thought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I just had a giga-brain thought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna swap 'em. I'm
gonna swap the labels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I really want this
thing but I don't have enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I had like one pound
and it was one pound fifty, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Imma change the label." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, (deep breathing), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heart was fuckin' racing going
up to the stand, to the till, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Fuck. Fuck.
Play it cool. Play it cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Play it cool." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's scanning 'em and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then, as he's
scanning them I realized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Wait, he's just scanned it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it doesn't fucking
matter what the label says </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's a fucking barcode." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, "Oh, that's
got the wrong label on it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Oh, does it? Does it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Wow, I never noticed, thank
you for pointing that out." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meanwhile, my heart is like
(imitates heart pounding). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Oh, shit." (deep breathing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the worst
thing I've ever done is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you know when, in England,
you know when they introduced </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the self-service machines, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is the closest thing
I think England's gotten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to a trust system, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And on top of this, England,
within our lifetime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> England has added a plastic bag tax. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which wasn't always there.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Normally you could
take as many plastic bags </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> as you wanted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Normally you could take as many
plastic bags as you wanted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think, how many years ago? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where they introduced the
5p tax in order to take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a plastic bag.
- Oh, like five years ago? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Five, six years ago, I'd say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like five, six years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and I remember this one time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was in a Tesco's or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I had like, I didn't
have my card on me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I just had gone out of the house, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I just had change in my pocket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I came up to the till
and it was self-service </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it went up to the exact
change of my shopping, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I hadn't bought the
plastic bag yet. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was just like, "Do
I put everything back?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah, bro, if I was
working there, I'd be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Bro, good on you for having
the perfect amount. Take it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I was just like, "Do
I put everything back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> run back home, which is
only five minutes away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and come back with a tenner
or my card or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to just buy this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Or do I just press the "I
have paid for one bag"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no, do I just press
the "Zero bag" option? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I look around, I start
like fuckin' sweating, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm just like,
"I'm a good Asian boy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never broken the law in my life." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, (inhales deeply)
check the security camera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Check the store clerk. Time fuckin' stops. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuckin' put the hood up,
baseball cap on. I'm ready. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you know when you've
felt like you've got a fuckin' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> spotlight on you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I just fuckin' leg it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How dare he steal a 5 pence bag? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And now that's on camera, so yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god.
- I'm a criminal, guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Absolutely criminal, Gigguk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, to be fair, with that one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I'd paid by card a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'd forgotten to put the plastic bag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're literally right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'd paid by card and I had
no cash on me and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I am not getting my
card out for 5 pence." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, of course.
- So I just take one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They didn't give a fuck.
They never gave a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Here Garnt's sweating and I'm
just next to him taking one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No because I'm pretty sure,
I've accidentally pressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zero bags when I've taken one
or two bags so many times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor inhales sharply) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's-
- No, Garnt. Say it isn't so! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the conscious
choice, you know? (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's that I consciously made that choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the confident press of the button. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the difference
between manslaughter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and murder, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I think that's why
the trust system works- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's conscious manslaughter. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's why the
trust system works so well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here in Japan, 'cause I
don't know if we've mentioned </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how they ID for alcohol
here, in konbinis right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is, they never ask for ID </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're buying alcohol
here in a supermarket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or a konbini here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause what happens is you take the beer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever alcohol you want, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the clerk scans it and
then there's this button </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have to press in Japan
that says, "I am over 18." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now-
- 20. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's over 20. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry, sorry, yeah it's over 20. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now, in England, this wouldn't work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Any fuckin' kid would come in and say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I'm over the age of drinking." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck, I remember, how
many kids had fake IDs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just went fuckin' clubbing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back when I was underage, as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But here in Japan, I can imagine
just like this Japanese kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just coming up and being like,
"I'm gonna cheat the system. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna do what's
called a pro gamer move." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Gets up to the cashier and he just tries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to press the button and is just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No. Can't do it. I can't do it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I'm a child. I'm a child. I'm sorry." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is literally the equivalent of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going onto a porn website
and when it says like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "You must be 18 years or
over," to enter the website. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And a Japanese kid being
like (sighs) "Shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a Japanese kid is just
like, "Officer, arrest me now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had bad thoughts." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - "I pressed yes. I was curious." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs)
"Take me away." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A Japanese kid's like, "Shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Turn on an anime. Full porn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Turns on TV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so pointless. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, as well, in
Japan, they have just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> vending machines with beer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Vending machines with cigarettes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd completely forgotten about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just on the street. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not until recently
that the vending machines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that sell cigarettes finally
started to implement- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah you have to have a card, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a card system to ID it because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the alcohol ones don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No the alcohol ones
don't. (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So a 14 year old will
be like, "What's Asahi?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they just fuckin'
order and realize it's beer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And there you go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's definitely kids doing that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 100%.
- 100% </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I did that. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would too.
- But yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, first time I was
working up in the ski fields, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like 16 and outside
of where I was staying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a vending machine
that was selling beer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Oh sweet, I
don't have to trek all the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to the other side of
the road at the konbini, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I can just fuckin' go here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure the police don't
give a shit if you not show ID, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> unless you're literally drunk as fuck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle of the street or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's going very far.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They've got better things
to do. Like complain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Complain about stepping too loud. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - ID a (speaks foreign
language) or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, ID a (speaks foreign language). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But me being the
(speaks foreign language) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the snow fields, I was like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, you fuckin'- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They just come around the corner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just bust me on the spot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This man fucking cracks it open, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the "Solid Snake" music starts playing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Dun-dun-dun.
(Joey squeals) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey imitates siren) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The (speaks foreign
language) opened a beer! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you guys ever stolen
your parents' credit cards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for anything when you were kids? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no.
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - My mom would find out
so fucking fast, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My mom checks her credit
card like daily, for like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there is absolutely no
way I could get away- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, I didn't even
know where my parents'- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never even wanted to.
- Credit card was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me, money wasn't a
system where you could, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I never viewed it as a system
where you could game it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I always thought of it as, I get money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I spend the money that I get. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I could earn money through things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was, I never even conceived, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not saying this 'cause
I think I'm like a good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm a good boy, I literally
never even conceived of the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I could take money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not even a good boy thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's just a boy thing. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I just.
- That should be common sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just assumed the only way
I could get it was through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> doing the tasks that I was allotted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe 'cause I played video games too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought task equals reward. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I genuinely never even considered, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I hear about these kids who steal their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> parents' credit cards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How is this so fuckin' normalized? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> To me, it was never even an option. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of like stealing my parents money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In my, when I hear that, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, you're like a nine
year old, 10 year old, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who just happened to get
their mom's credit card. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, how did you find that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause if I was a nine
year old and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Man I really wanna like throw
a Super Chat at this Vtuber." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not gonna think like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Where's my mom's credit card?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna start thinking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "All right. Let's start the simulation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where could my mom's credit
card possibly be in this house?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Solid Snake" music starts playing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I wouldn't even think about that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would rather, I'd have more luck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to trick my parents
by convincing them." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I probably have done
that before more than I have- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Mom, you don't understand.
They're my favorite Vtuber." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, because if they, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're the ones that put the details in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they don't like it,
I'm like, "Well you did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You put it in. You
listened to my bullshit." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You let me do it." (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm too big-brained. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Kids, you're amateurs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 year olds nowadays
are too lazy, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I should make guides on how to- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You gotta fuckin' "Inception"
the idea into your parents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - More kids need to be like Derren Brown, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the fuckin' big brain convincing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't steal. Convince other
people to steal for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what you should do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Isn't this like proxy
bullying or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> The whole thing, oh my god, that was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Don't bully. Get someone
else to bully for you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like social engineering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's so above me, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I was just such a
straight edge kid, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I think even-
- Same, to be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even when I was a kid,
I remember the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd ever gotten anything
from this thing called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the tooth fairy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Now, I'd heard about this
thing called the tooth fairy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from all my kids, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> From my friends at school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All your kids? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so not from all my kids. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> From all my fellow kids at school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were saying, "Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If your teeth come out,
you put it on your pillow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You get a bit of money." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Someone once got pounds. Maybe two pounds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Damn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a business
opportunity right there." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was the wrong
kid to tell that to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just going around
stealing people's teeth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, "Damn." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I remember the first
time I had one of my tooth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> knocked out, I was so fuckin' excited. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "My time has come. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Finally, the tooth fairy will visit me." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I go to sleep that day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and what do I find under my pillow? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Five fucking pounds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just like, "Holy shit! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm fuckin' rolling in it, man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But also, I was a good kid, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I knew my parents
weren't that well off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, "Mom, you know what I got? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I got five pounds. But you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't need it. Treat
yourself Mom." (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Aww.
- Wow! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't realize at the time,
I found out two years later, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just gave the five
pounds my mom gave to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back to my mom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, "Mom! I can't believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been swindled like this." (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - She probably thinks,
she's probably never been- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Money laundering at its finest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is there any prouder moment as a parent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than if you kid did that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's literally like the
whole Bible tales that you hear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You literally Good
Samaritan-ed that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I remember they
came into school and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they did this presentation one time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause, our school wasn't
like a Christian school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or anything, but we did
pray three times a day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then every single story
had to be fuckin' Bible story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I thought that was
kinda sus, but anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember this one story they told out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just stuck out in my mind and
I hated this story so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought this was the
dumbest fucking story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughs) Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They'd be like, "What
do you want for Christmas? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You could have five pounds or a Bible." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it was like, "Everyone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first person chose the five pounds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They got given the five
pounds and they were happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The second person asked
for the five pounds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they got the five pounds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they didn't want the Bible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The third person, they chose the Bible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And when they opened the Bible up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there was 10 pounds in it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "What is
the moral of this story? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even when I was a kid, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Are you trying to tell me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that every Bible has a tenner in it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I'm gonna go around and look." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And there was no tenners. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Wait,
so what is the moral?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Genuinely, now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is the moral of this story? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even 10 year old me was
like, "This is dumb." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is really dumb." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like that's not how it was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they're tryna be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Choosing knowledge over money is more," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Wait, wait,
wait. Hold up. Hold up." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is more valuable.
- I'm like, "Hold up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hold up. Price of the
bible's like three pound. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So wait, hold up? What are you?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "We can't guarantee
there's always gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> money in the Bible." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know?
- So technically, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> if I get the Bible, I take the
tenner and I sell the bible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for three pounds-
- Exactly, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's 13 pounds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was just like, "This is dumb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This is a dumb, dumb. Shame on you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You could've, you're so lazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I know I'm a kid, but this is so." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this annoyed the fuck out of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they told this thing like three times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in my whole school life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And every single time, I
used to get seethingly mad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they would tell this story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And no one else seemed
to be bothered by it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like, "Yeah
that's a good moral." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "This is a dumb, dumb moral." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This is never a situation you would be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> who asks you which gift
do you want, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's never gonna be
between money and a book. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's always, "What do you
want for your birthday?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not, "Oh which two do
you want? Money or this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, maybe the money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, what is this choice option? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but it's never
a philosophical question </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of which do I want, I'm just
gonna take the thing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want, this shouldn't be a fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a question of my moral standing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're giving me a gift
for Christmas, fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) It's like Christmas
is which one do you want, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the "Millionaire" music
just starts playing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like (heavy breathing). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] It really annoyed me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Can I call a friend?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just the whole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I really, really, really,
really, really despise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when they try and turn- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's really weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When they try and turn
very unreligious situations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or philosophical situations
into philosophical situations. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That have no right to be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "I'm just tryna
buy my homie a present. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna know what they want." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Genuinely. I'm tryna be a good friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If Garnt wants the five pounds,
that's what Garnt wants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imma give him the five pounds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who am I to preach that Garnt
wants to fuckin' Bible, bro? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He doesn't want that shit.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe he's not religious.
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not tryna save him. What is this shit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You want five pounds?
Are you sure about that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I gotta Bible! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And every year I got older
and they would tell this story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I would get more annoyed by it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the more I realized how
little sense it made. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this whole, I don't know
if this is a common thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or something that they
just told at my school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but they would tell
this story all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I hated it.
- I mean, I went to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Catholic high school and I've
never heard of that story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know if it's
something that they made up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this was like their
banger that they kept in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the person telling the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was just-
- This is the story that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gets people to discover Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "Oh, Lord!"
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, Lord!"
- "Oh, Lord, a tenner!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "You're not
a Christian yet? Oh, just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I remember one time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Connor, tell him the Bible story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on. Come on. Come on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I remember one time, as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they used to
tell my primary school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember, 'cause this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the one that really pissed me of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I just remembered this right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that the headmaster of my high school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was the primary school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the elementary school, who told it twice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Throughout the elementary school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember this, 'cause I always hated it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it always stood out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember it, my head, my
prime, the sub headmaster came in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he fucking came in and
he started talking about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "No. Don't
you dare tell this story." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he had the audacity to bring
in both the props, as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he couldn't just tell the story, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he had to ask the kids
which one they wanted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it backfired, 'cause
the first kid he asked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was from the same primary school as me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so he knew the answer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And so he asked, "Which one do you want, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the Bible or the five
pounds for Christmas?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the kid was like, "Bible."
(Joey laughs) Immediately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was like, "No. Have another go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Which one do you really want?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Bible." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And he had to be like, "Good answer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the correct answer
'cause there's a tenner in there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to reward your faith." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Fuck
off. No. Fuck, off, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate this. This sucks. I hate this." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this made me more not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this made me despise religion even more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> From a young age.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is not the way to
get kids into religion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. There's better ways to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's literally just tricking them, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just being like,
"Yeah this kinda untrue, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unrealistic thing, happens all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Take the Bible." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's just so many
of these religious things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that when you actually
break them down into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> real scenarios, just don't
work in a way that you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Just stop. Just stop." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't mind people's religion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all that, of course,
- Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not against that but when they- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's better ways to
get them into it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, when they try and
teach these stories like this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, just "No. Shut up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't wait for a
fuckin' Jehovah's Witness </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to knock on your door and you open it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just see the Bible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and a thousand yen in the other hand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're just like, "No." (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Grab the Bible.
- Grab the Bible, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> shut the door. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "Oh, sweet." (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "Just shake it,
shake it, shake the Bible." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you just grab the
Bible just, "Here you go." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just the dumbest thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why did I tell this story, again? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anyone know why I told this story? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't fucking remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think we were just
talking about, sorry? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] Morals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Morals.
- Morals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, it's the stealing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So moral of the story-
- Moral of the story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take the Bible, 'cause
there's a tenner in there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Always take the Bible-
- All the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If someone questions you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every Bible you see has
a tenner in it somewhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And in any other situation,
just take the fiver. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Unless you want to take the Bible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't need religion to
tell me not to be an asshole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm already doing that, frankly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm trying my best. You know?
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> When the man in the taxi offered
me the money or the Bible, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I took the money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - (speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like, "Excuse me, sir. Bible?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hope you all got that callback. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 4000 yen or the Bible? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, he was like, "Do
you want reimbursement </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or the Bible?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it was all a set up.
It was all a set up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - (laughs) What kills me is
what Christian out there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who is already a Christian
doesn't already own a Bible? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who out there who was posed
this question would be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "You know what? I was just
looking for a Bible, actually." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Oh, shit man."
- [Garnt] "Shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I needed a seventh copy
of the Bible in the house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll take the tenner as
well, thank you very much." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This has been like one
of the weirdest tangents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Starting off season two strong, I can see. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> My god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - (laughs) It always just annoyed me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm still annoyed about it, to this day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I go back, if I ever go to school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not gonna give a shitty talk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna, I should do an
even worse one than that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna come up with the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what you should do,
you know what I'm gonna do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> If I ever have a kid, I'm gonna
tell that story to my kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But not put the tenner in the Bible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, "You're dumb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> There's one of these in
every single hotel room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You coulda got one for free. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not a fuckin' hustler." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) Shoulda taken the five. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, how was this spread out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> throughout your entire region, or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, well, you
know, I think it's because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the area where I grew up was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone, every teacher
knew every other teacher </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the high school." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess you did live-
- All the police people knew- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In a small village.
- All the, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Odds are that is that half of your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> school would have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> all the teachers at the school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were people who went to the school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And all the people who got jobs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were relatives of people
who worked in the school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was all very tight-knit,
very, very tight-knit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I think all the stuff got passed down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything that they thought, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Well, this is a good idea," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just kept getting repeated and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, everything-
- Probably some dude being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, "I've gotta banger
story for you. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Check this out."
- Yeah, stuff you did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in primary school somehow
the high school teacher </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would tell you about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, "How did
you know I shit myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in third grade?"
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "How did you know that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Who told you there that?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, how do primary school
teachers still remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every student that they've taught? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the thing, the thing is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that this would be totally unrelated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> This would be a different
school, different teacher </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they would somehow
know the shit that you did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in primary school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, "Stop talking
to each other about me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't talk out of school.
Don't talk about me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Talk about me in school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't talk about me outside of school." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh.
- Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, it's back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Trash Taste" malfunction. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Completely unrelated, but
an hour after the FCCJ thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we did, I got two emails
from, I don't even know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if they're students or teachers or what, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from my high school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In Welsh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just from, saying, one
of the teachers misses me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) What?
- And I was like, "What?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - How does a teacher remember you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, actually I mean, they remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a small school and also, I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think we've had like my brother </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and my little brother went there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so three generations of ours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've also, I did talks there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You did talks? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, you went back to your school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- To do talks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did a talk there, which was terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I didn't prepare at all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just went there and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What do you want me to say?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you YouTuber? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All you have to say is I'm a YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and every kid is just
like, "Tell me more." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, so-
- Yeah, tell me more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm immediately interested. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll actually, actually, now
I have a frame of reference, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I've done two talks now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've done one talk at my high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for sixth form students, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which are like 17, maybe 18. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I've done a talk at
my mom's primary school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for 10 year olds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was very different experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I way, way, way enjoyed
talking to the 10 year olds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way more than I did the 17 year olds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause 17 year olds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're at that age </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they're way too
shy about everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they're starting
to get self-conscious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They hate life. I mean I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, everyone remembers that age. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so, even though I've thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, I'm a YouTuber, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a cool-ass job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd be fuckin', I'd be
like "Yeah, this is sick." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went out and they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right so who's got any questions?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuckin' no one had questions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Man, what's going on?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Am I not cool?"
- "Is it me?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Am I not cool?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is this not epic? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Are you not being
entertained right now?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Are you not entertained?"
- What do I have to do, dab? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll dab.
(Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You want me to dab? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What am I gonna do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I gotta TikTok." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I was like,
and then, oh god, shut up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I think the
teacher felt bad for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and he was like, "Oh, I have a question." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Oh,
fuck my life. This is so- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Do you know PewDiePie?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You got the pity question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I think they started
asking some questions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just terrible and I
had to talk in Welsh, as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm not, and I can talk in Welsh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm not as able to express
myself as much in Welsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you say YouTuber in Welsh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just YouTuber. YouTuber.
- Oh, okay. that's boring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Sounds like Japanese.
- Same in Thai. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, fair enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, YouTube, YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's kinda like a
slightly different accent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, (speaks in
foreign language) YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just that's it. But- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah and it was all
right. It was just fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I shoulda prepared more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I also didn't know what to talk about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Just ask me shit?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess the 10 year olds
woulda been better, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they were more curious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, they were great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They were fuckin' loving it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They were, 'cause I also
was doing it over Zoom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I had my streaming-
- Oh you did it Zoom? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it was like three weeks ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, shit. Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, you didn't tell me about this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you didn't tell me about this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was saving it for "Trash
Taste". (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. Fuck. (laughs)
Wow, there you go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank God I remembered. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're getting the same
experience as you viewers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I set up my streaming
stuff with the virtual webcam. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So basically, I had my
stream setup up to the Zoom, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and what I was doing was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's just my Phillips
Hues lights back there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I can control it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you were like, "So,
what do you think Twitch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, 10 year olds?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I had all the zooms
and the wide angles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like fuckin' around with that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and doing all the sound effects </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and doing all the memes sounds and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> while I was doing the
presentation for them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and answering their questions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You like these memes, kids? (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I was literally
doing live video editing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and these fucking kids
were losing it, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so fun. It was so satisfy- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Were you just in a private livestream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just did a private Twitch
stream, basically. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Literally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. It was so fun.
These kids loved it, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I bet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> every time I did the
fucking wide camera angle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they fucking started
pissing themselves laughing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they also all watched anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which was great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I remember you
saying in the FCCJ interview, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you were like, "What's
your favorite anime?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you said "Attack on Titan". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I assume you just said that
'cause you were just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "What's a popular anime every kid-" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So these kids were 10 years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They should not be
watching "Attack on Titan". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They should not be watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shoulda said "JoJo" and see if- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I don't think, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How far the net has been casted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I said "Attack on Titan" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and these kids all went like, "Yes!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like, "Who's
you favorite character?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Captain Levi." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, "Yes!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "What
the fuck is goin' on?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And they're like, "What's
your favorite sound effect?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I started playing with them and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> They loved it. They were like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I was surprised 'cause normally
the one question you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from kids is like "How much do you make?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> None of them asked that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was very, like "Wow. Nice
kids. Very respectful kids." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because at that
age, right, YouTube is still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of in the dreamscape, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not until you hit high
school where you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "So is it worth not going to uni for?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do 10 year olds care about
how much money people make? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never cared at 10 years old. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno, it depends on the kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But they were really nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They asked, they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, what age do you
recommend starting YouTube?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "That's a tough question." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause at one point, I'd
recommend stay as far away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the internet as
possible as long as you can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I'll also, on the other hand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting experience editing
is never a bad thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Getting good video
editing from like age 12 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just great experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, just for life in general. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Being able to make
videos is a super useful, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very handy technique
that will come in useful, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I guarantee, in your life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At some point you will wanna make a video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Even in a corporate
job, it's useful as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You will wanna make
a video at some point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And being able to make a
video and not shit yourself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opening software is very useful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - True, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was saying, "It's
all just being able to learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> something's great." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was great. These kids were really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "I," I sort of
felt like, I was kinda proud. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "These kids are
good. Good kids, these." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "They're askin'
the right questions." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Good lads, these lads. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, "You gotta
a good set there, Mom." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, "Did you like school?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Of course I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Only when my mom told me
to." My mom was in the room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, "Yeah, of course." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did you like school?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Of course I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what I told Mrs. Colquhoun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But secretly, no I didn't." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, this thing was it a Zoom call? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or were, was it like a virtual classroom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or were they in a physical classroom? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They were in a physical classroom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was on like a big screen.
- [Garnt] Okay. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I could see them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, at one point,
I tried to show them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my audio setup thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it unplugged and crashed my whole PC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, I texted
my mom, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Mom, I'm sorry, gimme five minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Gotta reboot my whole PC." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It was pretty bad, but it was good fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were really cute.
They were really nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna do that.
- I wanna do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds really fun.
- I'm sure, ask- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where's-
- Ask your- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey, Allambie Heights Primary School, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> gimme the email. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey, Baginton Mill,
come on. Come on. Come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm right there. I'm right there, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was just tellin' my
mom, I was telling my mom, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Ah, sure." 'Cause
my mom really wanted to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, maybe she wanted
the flags, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, hardcore. Hardcore.
- I don't know why Mom wanted, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they all knew I was a YouTuber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but my mom didn't want
to tell them who I was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause all my stuff is not
appropriate for 10 year olds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Fair enough." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, especially "Trash Taste" is not- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, let's not show them "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nevermind. Allambie Heights,
I take that back. (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe it's not a good idea for the kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to be exposed to my content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh you can call someone
and talk about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't have to know your
YouTube channel, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe the sixth graders can watch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but anyone below that, probably not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Baginton Mill, show
them the hentai episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey's like "Fuckin',
I went to a porn studio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I went to Porn Land." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Show them the episode d-link. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here's my favorite porno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Perfect content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll send you the Patreon
version, it's all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it was way more
fun than the high school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause the high school I just
stood there and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What do you wanna know?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were like, "Ah, nothing." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "You're all
boring. You're all boring." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like "We know what you do." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, because I guess at that age, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like you hear enough
about the behind the scenes of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTubers, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you kinda start to
explore further past the surface. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, I do feel that like one thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially in a small
town where I grew up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you're not told anything about
being able to do anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> outside of your small town. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, the most ambitious
thing you're told about doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is leaving your town to go
to another university town </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, the thought of being
able to go to a foreign country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and study was like never
even brought up to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was never even suggested to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was a possibility. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one in my school studied abroad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was not even mentioned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I feel kinda cheated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that was never mentioned to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I meet people who studied
in all of these countries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was just 'cause
their school was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, by the way, these
courses are available." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Why did no one tell me?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is my, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like, maybe it's my
teachers' fault, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone should've told me
that this was an option </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I coulda done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is something that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there shoulda been more
options told to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I went into there and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Listen, the teachers
are gonna tell you stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what they're supposed to tell you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But please, do your own
research and check for courses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that interest you, check
for international courses, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> check for stuff that's
outside of what is being told </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and fed to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because there is so much more options </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are so interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and way more fitting for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like somebody who hates engineering, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like myself, who did it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was never really gonna
get an engineering job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe I would, I'd realize
within two, three years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I despise it and I would quit
and go do something else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That might of been like a
deadbeat job for you I reckon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. It woulda been
something I despised, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was just because I didn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there was no other
options presented to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I almost feel like
the system was kind of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> failed, because it
didn't tell me anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just told these
are the courses I can do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Just choose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Or go to McDonalds, see ya buddy." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and I feel like
a lot of people do just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not a case of people
don't wanna do this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just a case of people just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know that it's out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I had exactly the
same experience with you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where the only reason I have a more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> understanding about international culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is because I come from an
international background </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and an international family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because my family flew over from Thailand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the only reason I knew, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but even with that background, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had no idea how many different
paths I could've taken, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in terms of study abroad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or have different kind
of experiences like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. If you speak fluent English, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can go and study in any
English-speaking country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And apply for an international student </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you'll probably get
accepted if you're not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't have like a
fuckin' criminal background. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You'll probably get accepted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And if I'd have known that I
coulda just gone to America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and studied I'd have done that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- 100%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I woulda done that.
- That's one of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> biggest life regrets, is
the fact that I got offered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to go study in Japan for two
months during high school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I said no, because I was too lazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's legit the biggest
fuckin' regret in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Same here. I think I always
had the same opportunity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to study abroad when I was in high school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just didn't take it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm like "Well, none
of my mates are taking it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so why would I take it?"
- [Joey] Yeah! Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm just like, well that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "I'm gonna be away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from my friends and family for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> three months, I don't want that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Instead I went to another
shit hole Welsh town. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm kidding, it was all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I would've loved to
have explored, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And done more stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And if I knew that was an
option, I woulda gone for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that's the main reason
why I went to the school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk to these kids, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was 'cause I was like, "Tell
these kids." Sorry. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck was that?
- "Teach the kids." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Gotta teach the kids." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I thought, I'd let them
know and just say like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Listen, you can do shit." (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, just do shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can literally do anything
you want, bro. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't let your dreams
be dreams. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, hopefully, one
of those kids looked up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and did something and had fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Probably not, though, I mean.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, 'cause even in university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there would be like courses where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd have the opportunity
to study at one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their sister universities
in another country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember, there were, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can tell the kinda people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who were going to study abroad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they just seemed like
they were up for anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was just like, "Man." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish I had the balls that you had. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Back when I was in
university 'cause I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that woulda been one of the
best experiences in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or just like a really valuable and, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a valuable piece of experience that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just didn't get until
later in life, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I feel like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> part of your life after university, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and especially during your mid to late 30s </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that you kinda realize that life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just kinda stays the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> unless you actively search
for new experiences. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah, exactly, that's it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I didn't realize that until after </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> university life had ended, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we were just really lucky, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as a kid, as a teenager,
whatever, to just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every year you'd kind
of get a new experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, once that period
of your life is over, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then you just have to
search for that yourself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just not gonna come to you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you gotta do that yourself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's why I feel like a lotta people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> who we, in the same area
who we grew up with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just didn't end up
staying in that same area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or they just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you go back home and they
haven't changed much, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's just because
they haven't realized that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if they don't do something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then nothing's ever gonna change </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and some people are comfortable with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's completely fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think there are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've met enough people in my life who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have like this urge to do something new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and do something different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but don't even know where to get started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should go for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I feel like, just go for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just do you- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You miss every shot
you don't take, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- That's like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just do something out
of your comfort zone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, at some point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you don't need
an excuse to do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, just take a risk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember, one time, my friend went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and traveled abroad alone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Wow. What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can do that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Just go somewhere for fun, alone?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember I thought, "Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm kinda jealous that this guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just had the balls to do that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now, I wouldn't mind doing that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't, it's not preferable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I wouldn't mind doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I wanna go somewhere,
or you wanna do something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't need an excuse to do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just fuckin' go somewhere.
- Just do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I always thought, I remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was talking to a guy who had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back in university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was talking about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was a guy in his 30s, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he was talking about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I used to work at this big company. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I just quit. And saved up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just traveled, for
like a year or two." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, "Wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought gap years were, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought you could do
that after your gap years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what gap years were for." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's just like, "No, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just did it because I just
needed change in my life." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, "Wait, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but what happens when you go back? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What, you have a career, right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just couldn't comprehend
someone just doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the life path that, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the career path that I was taught." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] You can do everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, yeah, the
moment you have your career, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, "Why would you willingly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just end your career like that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (laughs) Why would you just
quit your job like that? Ugh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, I mean, yeah. Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I was in that position, I'd
probably do it too, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And sometimes it does take that
kind of massive risk-taking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to realize that, "Oh,
maybe it's fuckin' worth it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to end your career. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe that career wasn't worth it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm gonna end my career.
- Be a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, YouTubers be like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just be a YouTuber.
- YouTubers be like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just gonna end my career. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just gonna end my
career. Go on a trip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but I feel like
especially this goes to most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> high schoolers, because I feel like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the point in your life where
you have the most opportunity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do something crazy with your life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not even something crazy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just something outta your comfort zone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Something that can increase
your perspective of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what happens in the world.
- Just try some shit out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it doesn't work out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try some different shit, until it clicks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, if you're about to go
to university at some point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you might be looking
for courses or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dude, look around for international stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever, there's tons out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anything that interests you.
- It'll be fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Trust me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember, the biggest
adventure I'd gone on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is just moving cities to
go to my university town </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and in England, every
city's kind of the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You get the same kinda experience, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get freshers week,
you go drink a fuckton, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the same, (laughs) it
was like the same experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no matter what university
I would've gone to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I wish I studied abroad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish I'd done something new. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I feel like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> after I quit to become a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was gaining back the
years that I could've had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'd just gone out of my
comfort zone earlier in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've definitely been doing that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since I've gotten so many
opportunities doing this job, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like I'm just
playing a catch-up game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm taking literally every thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that comes to my doorstep now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I didn't take any
of that shit, back then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Same, same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So and now I regret it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Being like, "Oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why was I so lazy and
dumb to not take these, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now that I look at it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing fuckin' opportunities?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now I know that, everything
that comes to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if it seems dumb or
pointless or whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just gonna fuckin' take it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I let "League of Legends"
ruin my life so I'm just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I put far too many hours
into "League of Legends" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "I want
something from them." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, you know what,
I'm gonna try something else, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Apex Legends".
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna, it's like I
quit "League of Legends", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I might try happiness
for once, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> See how it works out for
me, you know? (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - See which one I prefer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna see if it's for me, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Gonna see if being happy works out for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - This thing called
happiness, what is that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "League" players be like. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I've heard about that before." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my god, I hate "League of Legends". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was so, I've never
felt more empowered than </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> leaving "League of Legends". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like, "Wow. I have
more time for shit now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Look at that. Look at that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't touched a gacha game in a while- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Good for you,
Garnt. Good for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, the only reason I
haven't is because I filled </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that time with learning Japanese. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, "Well."
- The glow-up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I'm gonna have time
wasted doing something everyday </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> then I might as well
do it productively and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's not a waste then, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Exactly. (laughs)
- So, it's not a time waste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, that is like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or, I should say, time sink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There you go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause learning a language
is definitely a time sink. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "League of Legends"
is not a hour time sink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a four hour time sink. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs)
Minimum. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you get angry after it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At least with Japanese,
you're frustrated after it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You're not angry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're optimizing
adulthood right now, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know who else loves
taking opportunities and risks? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Our patrons. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just, I don't know. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a wild accusation, but. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sorry if you're a
non-risk taker patron, but. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was like a segue
that just veered off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and crashed man. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] You tried, Joey. You tried. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - An attempt was made. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, an attempt was made. That's right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - As usual, look at these lovely patrons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who are now funding this new studio. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We literally, our patrons
are now funding this studio, </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> we hope the results. </SPEAKER_01>
