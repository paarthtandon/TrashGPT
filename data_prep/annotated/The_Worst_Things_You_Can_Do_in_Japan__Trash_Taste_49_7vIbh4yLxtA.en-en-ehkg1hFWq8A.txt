<SPEAKER_00> - That's why we won't have a Meilyne cam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's just Meilyne just.
(computer keys rattling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also, I don't think people want to hear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> some of this stuff you
have to say, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't want to hear some of the stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm glad these microphones
are super condensed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and don't pick up everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - People don't know
what they're asking for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We'd have to cut so much shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if Meilyne starts opening her mouth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they're not getting it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Also Meilyne's just a
fucking normal employee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We're not just shoving
a camera in her face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hello, and welcome to another episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the Trash Taste podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am boss man one and I'm here
with boss man two and three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Here to get the dub.
- Ay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We are not the boys
anymore, we are boss men. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We are the boss men. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Why did we not call our podcast that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Welcome to the boss man podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no.
- Every week is a dub. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How are you boys doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good, good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm tired as all hell because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're in the middle of
moving right now, aren't you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, by the time this comes out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have finished moving, yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- But yeah, like literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tomorrow is the moving day for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I have been just
scrambling for the past week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like cleaning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't realize how much
stuff you have in your house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until you start cleaning your house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's always like that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I remember whenever I would move, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you start packing stuff
up and you think to yourself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It's gonna take a day at most." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you pack up like all
the main stuff in like a day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, "Oh, I'm
90% of the way packed." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then for some reason,
all the little shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just gets left over,
that takes like two days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like let me introduce myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you own like I feel like 50% </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the items you own, you
never use, think about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you think you need them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You also never see them either </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because they're either put in a closet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or kind of out of sight somewhere, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like when you have a
colander, you need a colander, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but you don't really think about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until you start using it or (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, "What the
fuck do I do with this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We have this like shaved ice machine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that I think Meilyne got it for us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But we had it for like the last summer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because Meilyne was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, I wanna like come
to your guys' place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And the girls can have a kind of girls day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we can just make
shaved ice or whatever." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Never used it.
(Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilyne] Once! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, we used it once and
it's just this huge brick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of a thing that's just like
sitting in the kitchen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Why is this here?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's always that one
drawer in every kitchen, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That is just the unused appliance drawer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right, where it's just these appliances </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that people give you as gifts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or that you think is gonna be cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when you host like that dinner
party that never happens, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there's just these
like random appliances </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that just get put into this drawer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you forget you even have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, but we have like-
- Like knives and forks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I use my hands. They're amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I got this kind
of cleaning service thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because okay, one thing,
we're immediately gonna go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> into this one thing I hate about Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Throwing away trash, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And especially the big trash, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like in Australia-
- It's us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just pick myself up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But 'cause I don't know about in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in Australia we have like this thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it happens once
every two or three months, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's called like council cleanup day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So basically what we do is
we take huge appliances, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like couches, beds, drawers,
all that kind of stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we literally just throw
it out in front of the street, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like just onto the street.
- As you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And basically you throw it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> People can kind of walk around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just grab stuff if they want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if they think, "Oh, you know, I can- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This happens every two to three months? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like every two to
three months or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How have I never seen this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- Have you seen this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Australia, yeah, it happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if maybe
that's just like the area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I grew up in? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, in the UK I don't
think there's enough space </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just throw you stuff- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I thought you were talking
about Japan for a second. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, not in Japan, in Australia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Australia we have that
where we just throw stuff out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then big garbage truck basically comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and collects all the stuff
that doesn't get picked up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> after like a week I think.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Japan doesn't work like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so we had to throw away our bed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is a queen size bed, a couch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and couple of tables and a
sofa and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of big stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like you can't just throw it out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the rest of the trash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Either you have to go to
your like local council </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, "I want to
throw this stuff away." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And they give you these like tickets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you have to pay for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To basically be like, "All right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm throwing this out on this day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you throw it out onto the street. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you have to book it and tell them- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have to book it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you have to tell
them the exact measurements </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the thing so they
can plan out the truck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or, what I've found
out, is you can just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just services out
there that you can just call up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, "I want to
throw all this crap away." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How much is it to get rid of?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Little more expensive than
the whole council thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but so much easier.
- Oh, I can imagine it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's not the price to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like we talked about last week, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just getting the paperwork done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That, like fucking I'm scared of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like I'm not even finished </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the fucking paperwork, dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we'll have to
do more after we move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause Japan is just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a never-ending sea of paperwork. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, I was like okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm getting rid of this giant bed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm getting rid of this couch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this table, all these like big appliances. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm like, okay, well
these are the big things gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you know, maybe like 30%
of my belongings probably gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was more like 3%. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like in like
your bedroom or office </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so many little things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you just never think about-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially my office-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- And my office has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so many little things,
I'm just like I'm... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, first of all, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm looking forward to the
moving company coming in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and seeing like all of
like my FAKKU skateboards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and shit like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just being like, whoa! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They'll be like, "Yo, is
that a rem, 1/8th scale? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, "Damn, son!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're just like giving
them a tour of your house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Being like, "Yeah, so
this is the JoJo section- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My free office tour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, actually, to be
fair, when the moving guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first came in to check to see what we had, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> he walked into my office
and he was like, "Whoa!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Otaku's dream, man.
- He was like, "Wow," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Jesus, this guy's got
a fucking collection!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had like the opposite happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where like I only use my
tatami room to film in- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Hmm.
- And I only use it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I have a big tatami room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that I normally do the cosplay videos in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm really bad, so I
never clean them up after, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just leave the cosplays
there until I do the next video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I clean it up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then one time, they didn't
tell me they were doing this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but there was like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were checking the fire
alarms in the building. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Yeah,
sure, come in, come in." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's going around my house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He goes into my office, you know, he looks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Yeah, I like JoJo." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He just looked at me like
I was a fucking weirdo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "All right, thanks buddy." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then as he went to my tatami room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Oh, shit, I just remembered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that all my shit was in there." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I go into check that he's there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this man is just standing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the middle of like
my cosplay everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The stuff reeked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just holding up something
to the fire alarm, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just looking like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Look down, don't look, don't
look, don't look at anything." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then after this guy
left really awkwardly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an hour later, someone else came along </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the same company in the building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and did the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Wait, why
am I being checked twice?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, was he like a spot-man? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I was- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Just gonna make sure my
friend got it right." You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like, "Yo, I heard
there's free cosplay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where's it at?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I had the exact
same interaction again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was like, "Oh yeah, sorry about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the mess in this room." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - By the way, I like JoJo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - By the way, I also like JoJo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, really, huh?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking weirdo.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But luckily as I said, I'm
pretty sure I mentioned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the previous podcast episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like we've got a service </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they just do all the packing for us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - My God, I can not imagine if
I had to do that all myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - God, I just kind of realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what I'm gonna have to
go through when we move, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because my room's gonna be fine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then I got Sydney's room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which the amounts of
fucking fucked-up shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Sydney's room... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whoa, be careful
that's the pussy of the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That was expensive! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I remember this one time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had to get our doorbell fixed, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Hmm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we thought our
house was pretty clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically, whenever
someone needs to come in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to check our house at
all, we just make sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sydney's room is just fucking locked off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a quarantine section, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gotta put up like a- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like Chernobyl. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "You can't go in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's an inclusion zone."
- You gotta put up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the R18 curtains </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> straight to the doorway, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Only adults allowed." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You put the fucking
biohazard sign on the door </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to make sure no one gets in, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's radioactive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So how we learned our lesson
was we had our doorbell fixed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and of course Sydney's
room was like cordoned off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we forget that sometimes Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just has shit lying
about the house, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I guess we've just
become so desensitized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to some of the stuff she reviews. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- My fiance reviews, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of lewd stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's her channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we just had like a bunch of figures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that were just left in the living room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with just like their tits out, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Living room material.
- As you do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What living room would
be complete without- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I see you've see my decor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's the "Mother Knows Breast," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> size real scale, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So this guy just comes in, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the doorbell's like
right next to the kitchen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And also we have a shelf
right next to the kitchen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which just has two lewd,
completely naked figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just right next to where the doorbell is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right!
- He takes a look, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looks at the figures, looks at Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and just doesn't make contact
with Sydney ever again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Has he got Hentai hair?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Hentai hair, his
hair's covering his eyes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just sweating.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and that was probably
the longest fucking hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he had to like enjoy of his life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when he was just fixing the doorbell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love how he immediately
looked at Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You wouldn't think that like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd look at like Garnt, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Being like this mother fucker right here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like leaving his lewd shit out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> No, immediately went to Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like, "God, I wish that was me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish my wife would let
me put my dirty figures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the living room." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's the one time,
whenever someone comes round </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, "Yo, these lewd stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not me guys, guys, that's not me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just my partner." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just like silently point at Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, seriously, seriously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's my partner this time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, I had to like,
'cause I have quite a few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doujins and stuff like that
in my bookshelf as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, I'll pack
these away before I... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I'm with these
guys for a couple of days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't want an awkward
experience for a couple of days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as they like sift through
my doujins being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "So what's the fragile stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and what's not the
fragile stuff," but yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So because of that, I have
just been so incredibly busy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't been able to like sit down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like playing any games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, Pokemon Snap came
out like a few days ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Haven't been able to like
download that shit at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're not ahead on
videos anymore, are you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is just like, I
heard that about Joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like,
""What what is going on?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, I think this comes
out end of May, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like the slowest
month I've ever had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like I think my next
video is not coming out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for like 12 days or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Fuck,"-
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My career is over dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I used to upload daily. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like the
signs of the apocalypse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is happening.
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The fucking sky's falling
and Joey's not ahead on video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's how I know at the end is coming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm so not ahead,
that I'm falling behind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fallen and I can't get up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I missed an upload as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it like killed me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I apologized on my YouTube
page and people were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You don't have to apologize." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm like, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, no I do, I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I'm not apologizing for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm apologizing to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like 12 days to the
average YouTube viewer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no difference between
seven days between videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and like two weeks between upload. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- But to the person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who makes it, it's like, "Oh, no." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, it's everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's all I think about, these damn videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, this is the
first time in my career where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been ahead on videos so I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> damn, I have some free time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Look at us!
- Look at us! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 2021, he turns the tables! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt uploads more than Joey or Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not yet, maybe one day-
- Maybe one day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll be back, I'll be back, don't worry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's play a game then. Come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's do it.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait until Garnt discovers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Five Nights at Freddy's, guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- It's game over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, I mean, now
that fucking lockdown's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been happening again-
- Hmm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess we can pull a-
- For the 17th time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever time it is.
- For the 17th time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, locked down in
Japan has been weird, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a roller coaster, it goes like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the cases go up, they
announce a shitty lockdown </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like two more rules added. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hmm.
- And then they go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay the case is good now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they go back up again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they let go of restrictions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then this happened like
the what, the fourth time now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So we're just doing the
same shit over and over again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But this locked down
is the shortest ever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's only two weeks or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think they- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's gonna change in two weeks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's the point? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think they literally
just wanted to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, Golden Week's happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's have it not happen." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you explain what Golden Week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is to the viewers who don't know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so Golden Week is this week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during the first week of May, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as we're recording this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're in the middle of it right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's basically just
a bunch of public holidays </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back to back to back to back to back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hmm.
- So I think, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so basically people just get a week off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you know how I remember Golden Week? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hmm?
- It was the one week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the year aside from like New Years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where Mangakas would take a break </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from their weekly manga schedule. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm just like, oh,
"One Piece" is on break? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck's Golden Week? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oda's like, "Thank God, finally!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything's on fire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I didn't get "One Piece" this week? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the only reason
I knew of Golden Week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before moving to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Well because I think,
Japan needs Golden Week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because Japan's one of the few countries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that works on Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hmm.
- You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Christmas is just like,
I think everywhere else, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Christmas is like a
public holiday or at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Australia.
- Christian world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah, like in
Australia, it's the second half </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of December until maybe
the first week of January, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like three weeks, it's
just full on holiday. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking Christmas here's
is just Valentine's Day 2.0. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, basically.
- It is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It really is.
- Who gives a shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but that was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I don't have a partner, finna work." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's either you're on a date </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you are working on something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I guess like, you know, to
Japan, they need Golden Week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's the one time
where they're almost forced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to take the week off
because otherwise they get, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you know, people
still are just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, fuck it, it's still
working week for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My whole favorite thing of
all the Japanese Government's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lockdowns is that they did
during the whole pandemic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the government thought
of this amazing idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> called go-to travel,
(Joey cackles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, that was a thing!
- This is just the funniest- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the funniest fucking thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So Japanese Government, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were losing a lot of money obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from tourism that they weren't getting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So in the middle of like the pandemic, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like months ago, this is before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is last year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This was during the
first lockdown, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like, "Guys,
we're losing too much money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in our travel economy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We need to put some money back into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What we're going to do is, guys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna give you 30% off everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we're gonna pay
you money to go travel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll give you 200 bucks to spend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depending on how much you spend." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you get coupons
at your destination. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were like, "Oh yes,
so like it's a lockdown." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But also if you travel, 30% discount!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey!
- Hey! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Here's some money to spend,
go treat yourself, king, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but don't leave the house
thought, but don't leave." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they realized it
was a colossal mistake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a month later, when
the cases went up a fuck ton </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because everyone's of course,
everyone's gonna travel! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, you're paying me to travel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't want me to travel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like if you went
to a five-star hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like a thousand bucks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it would go down to like
600 and then you'd be given </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 300 bucks to spend and it's
like who isn't gonna do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you have disposable income, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone is gonna do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like dangling a
carrot in front of a horse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and telling the horse not to run, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like don't, don't! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm finna, I'm finna try
and be responsible here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you Japanese government
making me act up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, well shit,
I'm going to Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> See ya, guys.
- Of course everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> abused the out fuck out
of that system, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because I--
- Everyone went traveling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because it was
like, why wouldn't I? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I went to like four different places. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like-
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm obviously not, 'cause
literally everybody is going. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? So it's like what's the point? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What's the point of not going? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was the most confusing period ever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they were like, "Don't
travel, but please travel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please, please travel, we
need it for the economy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then they shut it down, like after- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like a month.
- A month, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course, it was a colossal mistake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I went to Hokkaido cause
I was like, "Fuck, yeah!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't interact with anyone- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I think all three
of us went to Hokkaido </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> at different times, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. Why the fuck wouldn't I? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I went way after and
it was because you guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kept talking about
Hokkaido, and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, I think it's my time
to go to Hokkaido as well." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Waited for lockdown to
end and I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Damn, they weren't joking around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking Hokkaido slaps, man!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like middle of fucking
nowhere, no-one's there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like great, it's peaceful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, it's fantastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it was just the dumbest thing ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because if they just kept,
like this is the whole thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that the Japanese government are doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they just kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't really committed to anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They haven't really told
you not to do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They've been very wishy-washy.
- I think that's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Every restriction they've given, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it seems very half-assed
from my perspective. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not been like, we've
never been fully open, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but we've also never
been fully closed either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like they've never
said you can't travel around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The worst thing- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, if anything, they reward you for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then they also said like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh yeah, restaurants, please
close at eight," you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like suddenly for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people are just gonna magically stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting infected before eight? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, this new
lockdown, they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Restaurants can't serve
alcohol anymore," right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just like, so I'm still allowed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to go to the restaurant?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I just can't drink beer? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's generous to even
call it like half-measures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like-
- Like a quarter-measure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - A one-tenth measure is what they do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, you know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really care about
the whole politics at all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I wish they would just
decide what they want to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well that's the problem, isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that unlike a lot of
countries, the Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese law, they can't force
establishments to close down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Like a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of other countries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so they're like, "Okay,
so we can't force you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to close down, but we advise
you to not serve alcohol, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to close after eight," but
there's also from what I heard, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like a penalty for establishments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that don't follow those rules. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get a fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you make a fuck-ton of money, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the restaurants that make so much money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like, "Oh, we'll just pay the bill." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The penalty is so low that
there are a lot of restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out there, especially in like inner Tokyo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are just like, "We'll
pay for the penalty, fuck it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some of like the biggest restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think just pay the fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they just pay the fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they make more off of
the money that they make. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Then also the biggest that
was not even the fine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like, "We'll put
you on a list of companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that stayed open."
(Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And obviously to a lot of Japanese people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like pretty like, fuck,
we're gonna be on a list? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then for some of them, they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't fucking give
a shit about a list." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like getting on the naughty list </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on Santa's-
- Yeah, Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "Oh, no." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so, so dumb, so dumb. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the thing, this would have been, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least in Japan-
- Well, 'cause Australia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and New Zealand, like totally locked down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - New Zealand were like, "No." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no.
- No one could do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Australia locked down for
like nine months, like fully. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And people couldn't go outside
for more than an hour a day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And like all restaurants were closed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then when in Sydney, at least, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we got one case and the entire city </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went into lock down for like a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Meanwhile, Japan is like, "1,000 cases? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't drink at restaurants." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, cool, thanks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but I mean, it'll
be interesting to see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what happens in this next year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because every other country seems to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> getting their vaccines
and we are still like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're probably not gonna
be able to get our vaccines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this year if we stay in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's looking more and more likely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean, you know, there's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I know of a few of my
American friends who are here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are probably just
gonna like bite the bullet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and just go back to America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometime this year to
just go get the vaccine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Everyone in like my age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in America is already getting it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In the UK as well, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, UK as well.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like being a kid again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when they always got the games before you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like fuck, man, why you
all getting the good shit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's reversed now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan is the last one to get it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like Japan was always the first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now, you're the last. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I've been lied to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like are you guys gonna do it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm probably gonna do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I don't blame you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd fucking do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I was an American or from the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I would absolutely do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's twofold for me, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I want to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want go back to the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want to go back to
UK to visit my friends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want beans and toast God damn it! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, it's been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think this is longest I've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from like seeing my
family, seeing my friends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, same.
- Same, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I'm just like, that and the vaccine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I can get everything
done in one trip, then yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna take like a
month and a half off Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and just go do the things that
I need to do for my health. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And also catch up to all the things like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Beans and toast, just wanna have it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanna have some
beans and fucking toast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck my friends, just beans and toast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, there's no Heinz beans here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so fucking depressing man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I legitimately miss beans and toast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry-
- I crave it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think there's
a more depressing sight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> than just beans on toast by itself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> As a Brit-
- Listen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> baked beans tastes good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a Brit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like seeing the sight of
just like beans on toast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as like a fucking
breakfast, dinner, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's fantastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, I feel that way, nut
like two or three times a year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wake up and I'm like, fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I could go for some beans right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Baked beans- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Beaked beans, like Heinz
baked beans I'm like ah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Great source of protein
as well. You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what's not to like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like fuck me up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Beans are magical,
they're fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Make me fart like a mother fucker, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but still good.
- Who cares? Who cares? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels like you're being cleansed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like detox. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, that's the problem, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, at least you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like all my American friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have a choice to do that, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Go back, doubly like get a vaccine- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just saw like Australia
apparently made it illegal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to return if you're from India, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like illegal, like
you could go to prison </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if you return. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like what?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well that's the problem, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that like, I can't do
the same for Australia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we're in no
rush to get the vaccine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because no one's had COVID
for the past four months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like, not even my grandma,
who's like 92 this year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has gotten it yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like maybe- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You guys are isolated as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's hard enough to get
in your country as it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it makes sense, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, you know, that's
why Australia has done so well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and same with New Zealand, but still. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why if like the
whole world goes through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the fucking apocalypse, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Australia is just gonna
be there fucking chilling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Australia and New Zealand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are gonna be like the
two remaining countries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nothing goes in, nothing comes out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man, seeing the whole like
the whole Joe Rogan controversy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about all the like vaccines and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so frustrating that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally been the only
thing anyone can talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the past like year and a half is COVID </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and all this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's also like, you can't talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because everyone's fucking
turned it into a political thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where it's just like, I
just wanna eat baked beans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't want to die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just don't want to be ill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't want to get other people ill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and it sucks that
it's become like a thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like even now talking about
it, I feel like, fuck, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's probably gonna to
be some fucking assholes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the comments who are
like annoyed about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was talking about it and shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just want to kiss my
homie's good night, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly.
- Come on, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me kiss my homies. Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanna eat some fucking baked beans, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watch "Cars 2" in the theater, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean, wasn't
it like the UK recently, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think like couple of days ago? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just had their first mask-less concert? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like 5,000 people
at a concert or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and none of them were wearing masks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they were all vaccinated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not sure about, Meilyne, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can you like play fact checker? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure I saw
that this morning, but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not surprised either
because the UK has been, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean the US and UK have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so fucking good with their vaccines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I loved how in the UK where
they literally were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay guys, I think you can
maybe go out for drinks now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Literally like the first
day, London was like rammed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course.
- Of course it would be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they were like, "We've
been waiting like 10 years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for this, we're gonna go
get a pint with Jerry." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly.
- I can't quite imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how Wetherspoons was going to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as soon as they opened up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God.
- God, I do miss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a good Wetherspoons actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The government could tell, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if Britain had to fight
in like another war, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the government was
like, "Please fight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> please fight for us." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they'd be like, "Nah, nah." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, "Pubs will
be open if you fight." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They'll be like, "Where are we fighting? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where are we fighting?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is
about pubs and British people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but like it turns them into
something like ferocious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like when pubs come into the equation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they become like different
people that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they suddenly become more passionate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like people in Britain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weren't taking like the pandemic seriously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> until pubs started closing down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's like the-
- It's the end of the world! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like I sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't go to school or work, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Pubs are closed? What the fuck!? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck!? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is a political agenda. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> How dare they close the pubs! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the exact
moment it got political. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the pubs closed down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't believe these
politicians have done this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilyne] It was supposedly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the first almost normal concert. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> The first almost normal concert, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, damn, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I know British people though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we fucking lie about
anything to get into events </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They'd be like, "Yeah,
I've got a vaccine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Of course, I've got a vaccine." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Oh my arm hurts. Ooh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tell me if the Pendulum weren't playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I know British people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on, that's a fucking
lie. There's no way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come on.
- There's no fucking way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The amount of clubs with
like 16 and 17 year olds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with fake IDs, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> People are faking the passports vaccines. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, 100%.
- Vaccine passports </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the fucking bouncers give a fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - True, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could hand a fucking McDonald's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 10 coffee card at them as an ID, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'd let you fucking
in the club in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get out of here.
- To be fair though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if any country is probably going to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a fully normal concert first, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's gonna be the US or the
UK with how they're going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whether they should. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, when they should is
a different question but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, from what I've heard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like third party information, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from all my mates back there up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the one thing that
we've been doing well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the pandemic, which
is the vaccine response. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right?
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which it kind of makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we just fucking
bought them all up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck you other countries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We used that first world country money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Give us that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's pretty tragic though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like US/UK bought them all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then no one else gets it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly.
- What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's pretty tragic really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- 'Cause you get it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from the insiders there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, "Yeah, we're doing great." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you get over to- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, of course you are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How's the rest of the world doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah, fuck 'em. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's their attitude, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's pretty tragic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - True, true.
- It is what it is I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Money talks.
- Exactly. Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you guys been
doing in the meantime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You guys been traveling around? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You've been doing anything
interesting before the lockdown? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, before lockdown for a minute </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we could travel in the
little bits that we could. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We recently just went camping which was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, I couldn't come. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had plans I did really far in advance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, wait, shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to come camping with the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so Garnt, me, and
like four of our friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went camping in the mountains of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it was my first
experience camping in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and definitely was a very
different experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you've never been camping before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I recommend you go camping in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it is like (indistinct)
baby mode camping, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it really is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You roughly described it to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but you're saying there's
like electricity, there's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So let me tell you about this. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I've only been camping
I think once or twice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> else in my life, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So wait, okay, I have one question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you get like a lot? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's that?
- Like a square? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We had to book it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We had to book a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So my only other experience camping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has been just like in the
middle of the fucking fields. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I went on like a trip in Colorado </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where we just like rode
horses for eight hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we camped literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle of like
the woods in Colorado. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was what I thought- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it was gonna
be something similar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm not that experienced in camping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I asked the boys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So what should I be bringing?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so they gave me the
usual sleeping bags, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tents, warm clothes and everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and also like a power
bank to charge your phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I came in with the expectations of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I need to buy a big fucking power bank, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we're not gonna have
any power there, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We were camping for like two days. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So a friend had a, he
has this thing called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the Omnicharge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember the full name, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it looked like a battle station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember he-
- It's not that big. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like it was way bigger than any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the portable charges I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And also like what sold me
was that it had it's own plug, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you can plug like-
- Power outlet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like an AC adapter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so you can plug like
power adapter to it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like I want something
like that for a camping trip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I asked, "Oh, what's
this thing called?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he says, "It's the Omnicharger." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I Google it on Amazon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and unfortunately they're not
selling on Amazon anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I go to like the first link </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's recommended for like that search. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And here's the thing about Amazon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that you see a charger, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's nothing to like quantify
how big this charger is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just from the image.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, there's dimensions
but you might not look at them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes it's like
buried in a wall of text. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's buried in wall of text </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I just see this block, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm just like, it's
probably around the same, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, it's recommended from
me searching the Omnicharger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's probably about
the same size, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking A. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's probably around the same size. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thinking back, like
being like an electronic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and ex electronic and electrical engineer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got a master's, I should have seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the amount of like charge it holds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I didn't look at the
amount of charge it holds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like on like
fucking autopilot mode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, okay, that looks good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Buy that, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I wait a few days from
all my camping equipment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I bought, and this
fucking massive package, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish you brought it with you today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish I did. I wish I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This massive package
gets delivered to my door </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everything's like boxed up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I don't know what everything is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the first thing I pick
up, it's fucking heavy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's this fucking brick and
my first thought was, oh no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have I bought like a sleeping bag </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just like 10 times
heavier than I need it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right.
- And so I start unboxing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I see this fucking brick
just in my hands, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't remember buying
anything this heavy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Turn it around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's the fucking charger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, no way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How big is it?
- This must be a mistake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I have a photo of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So Joey has a photo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's on screen right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The photo of this brick that I got. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I turn it around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I look at like the
appliances that it can power. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like, okay,
so this can power phones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It can, you know, charge tablets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it says you can charge laptops. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It can power a fucking mini-fridge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just like, it
can power a mini fridge, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a microwave and I'm just like, oh shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck have I bought? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This thing he bought it
literally is like, oh, I found it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So this is like a fucking
brick that I bought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like two routers
strapped together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, what the fuck- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a Mac mini. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know what I'm going
to be able to do with this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause like I can't take that on a plane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause like if I take on a plane, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the TSA probably thinks I'm
gonna bomb the fucking plane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'll get fucking
arrested on that plane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I'm probably gonna
put on the fucking ISIS list </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I take this on a plane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I can't even, so I'm
just thinking to myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, guys, I've made a mistake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's okay because
at least I can use it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on this camping trip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like I lug this massive
fucking brick in my suitcase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or in my bag, sorry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which is probably like by itself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the heaviest single object
in my bag for a camping trip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so we get to this
campsite and you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we get a lot and we start
unpacking everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I see this metal box, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I see this metal box. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like, "What
the fuck is that metal box?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My first thought was, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's probably like a safe
they provided, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I hear about
some American campsites </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having like bear safes or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I was thinking, oh, it
might be a safe or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I was like, "Nabi, what's that?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's just like, "Just
wait, Garnt. Let me show you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He opens it up and it's
a fucking power outlet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Two power outlets are
sticking out like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah yes, camping with my power outlet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just like, "So wait, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's literally no fucking reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for me to buy this fucking brick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and lug this around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't take it anywhere,
can't take it on the plane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and apparently it's
useless for a camping trip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck do I need this for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally, I looked at
that thing and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "That's what people use
for like emergencies." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When like your house is flooded
and you have no electricity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and like this is the
thing that like powers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> your house for like a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just thinking if
Japan Sinks ever happens, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm fucking sorted, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are like the top of the hierarchy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like people could be fighting-
- You could power </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a flood light. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because I remember the first night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he like charged his phone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, he was like, "Might as well use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this fucking thing I bought" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So he charged his phone, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like a 100%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Next morning, phone is fully charged. 97%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He used 3% of his charge
to power his phone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like this thing could last you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like literally like two months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I literally-
- It's insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I literally bought it just
so I could recharge my phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> during the duration of this camping trip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Doesn't it have like
it's own ventilation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like fan inside of it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, I knew it was
like fucking way too overkill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when I opened it up, it had
a vent that had like a fan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He turned it on and it
literally started going (buzzing). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah so, 3% to power
the fucking fan probably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 1% but he charged his fucking phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, but like I've been camping
quite a bit in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like my dad and I used to go camping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want to fucking
camp with a power outlet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck?
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like I realized, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan does not know how to go camping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because like it really is
baby mode on (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we had like some
relatively small tents, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you have neighbors? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. We had neighbors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's that's the thing
that really put me off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it was one lot apart so
there was social distancing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was one lot apart,
it was social distancing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I bet he could fucking hear you fart. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One thing I learned about a tent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that it's just not noise proof at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- You can hear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Literally, I remember we were sleeping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I could hear like the
other tent fucking farting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the background. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just. "Okay, who was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Was that you Nabi?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. Whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like some of these tents
that these people bought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they weren't fucking tents. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So some of our neighbors, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One lot's like two lots down from us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They start unpacking this tent, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then this tent has
fucking compartments, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then not only that,
I remember walking past, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they had an entrance, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They had an entrance that
had lights on the entrance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like fairy lights. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And this tent had like
two fucking bedrooms, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a living room.
- Oh, my parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> had a tent like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that even a tent, though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's like family tent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just a pop-up apartment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but it's like a family tent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just like this isn't
a tent, this is a 2LDK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, those tents are a
fucking nightmare to set up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- They're a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, but that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like I get it if it was a family, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but this was a couple.
- This was a couple. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, it's 'cause you're a Japanese couple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so naturally, you're not
gonna in the same bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was getting to that
because this like this tent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had carpet, had shelves and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might as well just bring a
fucking caravan at this point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, we'd take that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but we stayed for like three weeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That makes sense if it's three weeks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They stayed for a single
night and like okay- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - A single night? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, a single night.
- Yeah, a single night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They came with us and
then left the same day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So here's the premium Japanese couple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experience that I saw, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we walked past this tent, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And of course this
Japanese couple, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously very intimate Japanese couple </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be going on a camping
trip by themselves together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Very intimate.
- Very intimate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the peak Japanese couple experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was seeing the guy next to his car </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on a fucking gamer chair or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then seeing the girl on the other side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of this massive tent on a hammock, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> both of them by themselves,
not interacting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> premium Japanese couple experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, isn't that love? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Knowing when to ignore each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's love. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean, I say it's
a premium Japanese couple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience because the amount of times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like we've gone to like
onsens or ryokans or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and like it's just like us, the boys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're just surrounded
by Japanese couples. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They don't talk to each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not talking to each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They don't talk to each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just not interacting with each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Couples that social distance together, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stay together, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're just social distancing, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But like one part I
couldn't fucking believe was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with wood-fire, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you had to like go to, well, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they have the option to
go to like the reception, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quote unquote, where you
could buy pre-cut wood-fire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. That's normally how it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] All right. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause they don't want you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just fucking picking
shit up around the area </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and burning it.
- Right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like the thing is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's we did.
- That's what we did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because each bundle was like 500 yen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe for like a bundle about- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it wasn't about the price. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't about the price
because like this wood, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like pre-cut
and clean and dry, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this thing burns through
like so fucking quickly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like we're here
for the entire day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We want this fire to keep
going the entire day, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This thing is not gonna
last us the entire day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I just said, fuck it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just like went out into the bush </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just grabbed some wood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and our friend Nabi had a hatchet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, "Give me that shit," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just fucking started like
deforesting this fucking forest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking die, (indistinct) forest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, we wouldn't
deforest the forest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were already like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bits of dead trees on the ground. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bits of dead trees on the ground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that we just cut up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't cut down any trees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey just starts his
fucking Animal Crossing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this fucking campsite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To emphasize, we
didn't cut up any trees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> We just cut off some branches
that had fallen down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we cut the logs
into like sizeable pieces. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah and brought them to our campsite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that to me is the
camping experience, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We're out in the wilderness with like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like out here in
like a fucking swimming pool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> treating it like Bear Grylls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's the thing it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We wanted to make the most of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We wanted to make the most of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because otherwise we would've had to spend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a hundred bucks for firewood. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, fuck that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, it's not about
the 100 bucks of firewood, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not about the money, Joey! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's about the experience! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's about the experience! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The most amount of fun
going out into the bush, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> picking up some like dead
trees and just bringing it back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just chopping the shit out of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was the most fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd be so fucking bored if I turned up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like I got like 10 neighbors, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got a power outlet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Fuck man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's like, pre-packaged. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here you go. Here's
all the things you need. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Go have fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All fucking micro-transactions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with your camping experience, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Probably like bring your food if you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know some camping trips
actually bring you meat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and a grill, if you want
to have food for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like just stay at a hotel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The best part about camping, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is when you all turn up, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you're one mate is
like, "Boys, I brought bacon." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone's like, "Yes. Let's go! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly.
- He brought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking perishable foods. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What an idiot, but it works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, and in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a little place you
can just kinda ask them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like "Hey, can
I camp on your land?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like, "Yeah, sure."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a lot of places
where you can camp- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, in Australia there's
designated camping areas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like it's first come, first serve. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's full, then fuck
off somewhere else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there a place like that in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or is it all regulated camping? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all regulated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, fuck.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it was fine for
the experience it was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I definitely prefer
the camping experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had in other countries
because it just kind of didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like camping, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, there was that
other couple next to us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that brought a fucking TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah! (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, I'd do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd do it too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they're like playing Smash Bros </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever the fuck it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, just like, why
are you even camping, dude? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, if you've got a fucking plug, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why not bring the 50 inch TV? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess so.
- I guess so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why not bring the 50 incher, bro? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I guess so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, you think that these guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have been like permanently living there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with how much shit they have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, truthfully,
I tend to bring like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you can get
those like really shitty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 19 inch battery powered monitors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can bring that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can bring a Switch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The thing is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've had a pretty
fucking stressful week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because of the whole move thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's just so nice to just sit down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and look at a fire for 12 hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and literally drink
and talk about nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was the best fucking experience I had. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is the best part of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, who set up the tents? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We all did.
- We all did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We all did, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you really, did you all? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Did you really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we all did, we all did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really, 'cause most of
the time it's "we all did" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like I watched
the other guy do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Our tents really
weren't that complicated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- 'Cause our tent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> literally just like a triangle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One of one of those fucking pyramid tents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't fucking inflatable apartment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't a two bedroom apartment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like 15 I had
the ones where you like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you fucking throw it
in the air and it psh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like Nabi had
one of those as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pain in the ass to fold up though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Ours was a bit more complicated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we still somehow fucked it up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because, so our tent was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like not pre, I mean,
it kinda is pre-built </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we kind of have to like
strengthen the supports, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the support beams that
it comes with, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Support beams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What they are called, the structure? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Poles.
- Yeah, the poles, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The bone structure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't fucking know what it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Poles, it's just fucking poles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't a pole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was like part
of the tent, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So this tent came with like support beams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like supported the structure, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all just fucking poles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's baby mode, tent mode.
- Baby mode, tent mode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We literally didn't have to do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We just had to like fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, we thought we didn't
have to do anything, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it all kind of like
unfolded and we like put it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All we had to do was
like put the pegs down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We thought great, job done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We didn't know it was job done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because when we were trying to sleep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when me and Joey were trying to sleep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just kept caving in, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it was also windy as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a windy ass-
- It was insanely windy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a windy ass night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so like every like fucking hour, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd get woken up by
this tent just caving in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just have to like bring
the support pole up again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like oh, for fucks sake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] It was horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I could hear Joey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like having trouble sleeping as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did not sleep at all that night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was only when we were packing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we took the cover off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, at the
top of the support beam, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was this label that said, "Push." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh, why does
this label say push? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I push it down and I just hear click. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And everything is like solid as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like Transformers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything just clicked into place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just hear this click and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What was that click?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I tried to like
push in the support beam- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you not like read
like the manual or anything? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no.
- Clearly, we should have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it was a tent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll just give it a
quick like gaze over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not used to tents like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm used to the ones that you
have to like kind of connect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the poles together
and do it yourself, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, oh cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who bought the tents? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, Nabi did.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I was like, oh, I've
never seen this kind of tent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but it seems easy enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It literally just pops out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some reason whenever you
fucking do your friend's tent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the biggest piece of shit ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like your tent pristine, brand new. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> While your friend's tent is
literally like falling apart. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The poles don't fucking
connect, they're rusty as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like what did you do to this tent? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How did you put it in this bad condition? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know.
- I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I always had that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but like that night
it was so fucking windy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, the day before
it was so fucking raining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that we were just like
we're not camping out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a torrential
thunderstorm out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- So we're just gonna fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we just went to like a nearby dyokon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but the next day though, when
we actually went camping, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was fucking great.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a great experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember Aki the next day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Aki was like, "So what
did you guys talk about?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just sat there and was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't matter what you talked about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck, what did I talk about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's talked about in
camping, stays in camping. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't ask us that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was clearly so unimportant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that it didn't even retain in my memory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All I remember is, ooh, a fire burn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all I remember
from that camping trip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your caveman instincts come out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember trying to start
a fire for like a full hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause Nabi bought these
flints and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Guys, guys, we've got a
power outlet right there." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like in a Bear Grylls- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just get a fucking outlet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And Endo, the entire
time was standing there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with a blowtorch and he's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Ready when you are, Garnt."
- Why does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he have a blow torch? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Why does he have a blow torch? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You making fucking creme
brulee on the campsite? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So there's just me like huddled around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this fucking moss trying
to set that on fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, I try setting like so many, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I try like getting
some YouTube tutorials out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried this for like a full fucking hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just fucking torrential
rained the day before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so all the wood's gonna be wet and shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And meanwhile I'm
just like sitting there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my gamer chair just
playing FireStarter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on, you got it, you got it, mate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just wanted to play
Bear Grylls, man, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was almost scary how
enthusiastic Garnt was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to start a fire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was just like, you know like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like we got there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You make it sound like I'm
a fucking casual arsonist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are, Garnt, you are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We got there, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we're like all right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's figure out what we're going to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are we gonna set up a tent? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, everybody help
get all the stuff out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And Garnt's just kind
of standing there like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I just can't wait to start a fire." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's how people become arsonists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Come on, come on, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's not pretend that the
start of a camping trip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is always when you are able
to stop first start a fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, of course.
- That's how you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the camping trip has begun, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I knew from how enthusiastic you were, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt's like in the car
lighting stuff on fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I knew from how enthusiastic
Garnt was to start the fire, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, if I let
this man start a fire, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he's not gonna do anything else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's gonna stay next to that fire, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fueling that for bitch for like 12 hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause who the fuck
enjoys building a tent? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like nobody actually
enjoys building a tent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fiddly as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Half the time you're trying to figure out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how the instruction manuals work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You mean the instruction
manual we didn't read? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's a fucking pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You try and figure out like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somehow they've picked the images </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that make it like the least legible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like the least
understandable to like figure out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how to build this tent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man, it sounds like you took
the monkey brain on the trip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't need to come. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There was already monkey brain there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt was very monkey
brain around that fire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like he was like (panting). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I feed it more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was single-handedly fueling
that fire for like 12 hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This fire went on for like 12 hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was the one like
fueling it every time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't have to do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like Garnt's
assistant right here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like fueling it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We need to look for like an actual place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where we can camp, like legit camp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Legit camp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if we'll
be able to find that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No power outlets.
- I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if we'll be able to find that in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure we can find it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What was your camping
experience like in England? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - In England, I didn't go much in England. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I went around France mainly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot of the time in France though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it was like campsites like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who'd you camp with? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My family for the most part, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but then obviously, 'cause we're in Wales, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's really easy to
just camp for a weekend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And normally you were just
like in a farmer's land </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in like some fucking random field. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, like land that someone owns. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause they'd always know someone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You could just be like, oh, can we camp? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And maybe it'd be like a tenner a night </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they didn't really want anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they were just like,
"Don't just leave a mess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just clean everything up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, 'cause you can't
do that in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It needs to be in like national reserve. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you can do whatever
you want on the land. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And normally you're right
next to woods and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so obviously there's no
power outlets or anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and probably a decent
walk away from the car </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that you came in.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So yeah, it was just good fun though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you just normally
just set up the tent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> If you can get fire going, go ahead, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it might be raining a fuck ton </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you might have to start
drinking beers in the tent, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like four of you squished
in this tent like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "How you guys doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Someone wanna boil the kettle? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll get some pot noodles going." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whatever you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We did like a Duke of
Edinburgh as well. We did that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah.
- That was good fun as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't even like put
a fire on the ground. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you need to buy like a fire pit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, 'cause sometimes in some places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to clean it up yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was easier to just bring something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you could wrap like all the ash in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is like, I think
we did that a few times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause if you have to clean it up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes it's an absolute pain in the ass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting rid of all this ash. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, because in Australia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all you did was just dig a hole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then once you were done with the ash, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you just fill up that hole again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's good for the land </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I mean, sometimes you
can't do that in some places. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Ah, true, true, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I mean, it's whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just kinda like, it was never
more than like two nights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was always like a night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Put the tent up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Kind of get drunk.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Eat a lot of bacon in the
morning, bacon sandwiches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Then just fuck off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, two nights I feel is
like the optimal camping time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'd say so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Two nights is about right before- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It depends, 'cause you need
something to do the second day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because the first night,
you're setting up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're having a few drinks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What do you do during the whole second day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before you start drinking? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't immediately
like start drinking beers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at like 11.
- I mean, that's what we did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's kind of what we did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I guess you can, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then there's someone
like driving, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I kind of want to do something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, well that's when
you can bring the TV </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and connect it to the power outlet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like who's got the Switch? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, 'cause if you go
camping with British people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, and there's like four of you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like a 24 pack, sorry,
I smashed so much there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a 24 pack won't last more
than a night of beers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean?
- That's true. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's like how much
beer are you bringing along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for this thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't do day drinking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You need like 40 beers at least
for that whole experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, that's why
I like doing something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean, we brought
like a pack of cards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like, you know, that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, we never cracked them opened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We just left them there
for like decoration. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was just having too much
fucking fun with the fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's like way too
enthusiastic about the fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was this fire burning like 24/7? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Well not 24/7. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was burning or like
a good like 14 hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus Christ, God, you monkey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because we fucking adventured
out and got all the wood. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was half the fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what did you do the second day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You said you slept in
the tent the first night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, we didn't sleep
in a tent the first night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because we got there like
super, super early on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the second day because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The first day it was raining like crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the first day we
missed the day of camping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we did what anyone do and
just had a nice day at an onsen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and slept with a nice roof over our heads. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we just went there the second day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we just basically
stayed there all day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, We got there like
9:00 a.m. or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like super early in the morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it was like a full, full day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I was in the area near you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the storm was fucking brutal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, the storm in
Tokyo was brutal as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Was it? I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was kayaking and then I was
on like the ocean kayaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the guy who was with us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like, "Oh, there's a storm coming." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Yeah,
I can fucking hear it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like (imitating rumbling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like rumbling everywhere.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then suddenly
I'm just like kayaking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just chilling, you know, nice weather. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then suddenly out of nowhere, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like torrential rains starts pouring down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just will not stop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking freezing as well, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, I literally felt like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was at the "Shawshank Redemption" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when he's crawling
through the tunnel of shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the rain, it was like that bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like I feel like I'm
crawling through the shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to get back to shore
because I'm freezing right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm fucking like, "Ah!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wish I was camping instead at that point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was really good fuck
kayaking until that started. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah.
- Good fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - God, I haven't been kayaking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never been kayaking
in the ocean I don't think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been kayaking on
like rivers and lakes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't think I've ever
been kayaking in the ocean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's good fun, it's chill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It seems a lot scarier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Something about the ocean
just scares me. You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I mean, the ocean
is just scary, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a scary place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Normally, a lot of
these things, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unless you own your own kayak and stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't just go and do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're renting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's normally always a
guy that comes with you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To make sure you don't fucking drown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But if it's a lake, like
you know, fucking whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I was like in a group </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a bunch of Japanese people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like one of them just like capsized. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, how the fuck
did you manage that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably did it on purpose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He just flipped his boat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and was just like in
the middle of the ocean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, how the fuck's
he gonna get back here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He got back in somehow, but my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that man must have been freezing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I had like my phone on me as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I'm not capsizing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, fuck that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You put your phone on you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on a kayaking trip in
the middle of the ocean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I sent you a picture of the snake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that was on the ocean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I was like going, we
were kayaking past like rocks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was doing this kind of thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you could kayak around like rocks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like you go through like
caves and stuff, kayaking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was just this like
fucking snake just chilling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like some kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like the entrance to death. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like fuck, let me
me get a quick 4k pic of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whipped out my phone
and started taking pics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (indistinct) in 4k. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For the fucking snake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. It was good fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I wish I could
go camping with you guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean, yeah, we
definitely want to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, Garnt and I still
have all the stuff with us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so we definitely want to do that again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gonna get a driving
license now, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, honestly, this camping trip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> single-handedly convinced
me to get a driving license </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause just like the
drive to this camp site </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was fucking beautiful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were driving up these mountains. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The weather was perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, the moment you leave Tokyo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the views get like insane.
- Yeah, 100%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's like you always
want to drive in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you're like, I can't
wait to see the views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> All of the service stations are amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the food you can get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the service stations here are insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like when you stop at the
service stations in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know about America, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like on like motorways or what
are they called in the US? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Highways.
- Highways. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, when you stop at them to break, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like McDonald's, KFC, it's
like I don't wanna stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> When you stop in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like you can get like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, the services areas, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get like ramen, curry,
sushi, all like fresh as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's so good and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well, of course I want to stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I want to get my coffee- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The one we stopped at had
like a full on like fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like a mall.
- Yeah, it was nuts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At the service area. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you get really good fucking food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like sushi, ramen, all that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just fast food here, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's such good quality as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm out here at night and
there's like a Yoshinoya </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the service station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, it's 10:00 a.m. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna have a Yoshinoya
beef roll, let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the one we stopped at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> had like a like fucking
Starbucks and like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah.
- It had like a whole, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like almost like
an anime shop. wasn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That was selling like
anime goods randomly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, yeah, they were
selling like "Initial D" merch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah man, it's so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You stop, you get that fat meal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you grab that coffee, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you start playing the music on the car, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just literally driving
with the Mount Fuji view, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clear as day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck you, Chris. It's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't beat it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we got an insane view
of Fuji during the day, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause that's the
thing about Japan, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like everything here is so aesthetic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, like even looking
at Mount Fuji, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You look at Mount Fuji
and I'm just like, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God really pat himself on the
back when he made that, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Jesus Christ, like Mount Fuji- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like my finest work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mount Fuji, like you talk
about Mount Everest or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like the highest
mountains or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuji is like the most photogenic mountain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is the most
picturesque mountain. 100%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the best spot as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- It's so good, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like everyone's so
nice driving on the expressways </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff here and like the roads, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's so chill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's pretty hard to find like
an asshole driver in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Everyone's so nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, no, no, you go ahead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone's really nice. You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's super chill driving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like driving easy mode
and you get like all the best, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everything's baby mode here, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So now Garnt, you've
got to go through the hell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of getting your license changed- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's the thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like I didn't have a reason to drive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or to want to drive and now I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the quicker you get it as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can get rid of those rookie things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that they have on-
- Rookie things? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, like the stickers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, for the first year
when you get your license, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though you've driven
in other countries, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to get these rookie stickers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on your front and back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a provisional kind of sticker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I don't like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a pain having to
remember them all the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bringing them along with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, "Oh, sorry,
gotta bring my stickers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I gotta put them on." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sorry I interrupted you, you were saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't remember what I was saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I guess the only
thing I remember is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I am not looking forward
to doing more paperwork, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is what I'm gonna be
doing a lot of this year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japan is like the never
in cesspool of paperwork. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get the paperwork done
when it's not stressful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So that when you-
- That doesn't happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no.
- That's a trick question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you got shit happening, you're busy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the last thing you want
to do is lose a day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you have the time to lose a day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do it now when you can, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's why I did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bold of you to assume that
we just have a day to lose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't have a day, but
I had a day where like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't that bad if I lost it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause like you know,
when I eventually move </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the end of the year, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gonna be fucking hell.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm not gonna want to lose a day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's gonna be more than a day, trust me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get it now, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not about losing a day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's about losing a day to paperwork. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's never gonna be good
so just fucking do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, I mean, it's just finding, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not even the motivation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but just like every time I wake up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like maybe today's a
day and today's never the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's like a Denny's
near the place as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you should be fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like a Coco's diner.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> - I'll see you guys at the checkout. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Speaking of leisurely activities, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys went snowboarding- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ages ago.
- Ages ago, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think we talked
about that on the podcast yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think we have, no, it was my- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I couldn't go to that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It was my very first
experience snowboarding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hmm. How was that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was, so obviously I went before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like we remembered that the reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted to try out
snowboarding was purely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of SSX Tricky and
Snowboard Kids on the N64, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah, had the choice
between going snowboarding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and going skiing and I'm
just like 100% snowboarding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want that SSX Tricky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because everyone told me
that it's like way harder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to start snowboarding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like beginners find it easier to ski, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like harder to master, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whereas snowboarding
is harder to get into, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's easier to master
from what I've heard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Roughly.
- I think that's true. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and I guess like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so my first experience
snowboarding was that, it was okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't realize how
much I took for granted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friction in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How so, Garnt, how so?
- How so? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I remember the first time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so we got all dressed up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I put on all the kits and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Put on the snowboards on
like one shoe or one foot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or however you lock yourself in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, so my first mission was to walk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from where I put my
snowboard on to the ski lift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember trying
to take my first step, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately slip, and I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is a bit of a challenge, innit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait, so you're telling me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna have to go down a fucking hill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I can't even take a single step? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it's the type of movement </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd never do otherwise, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so unnatural. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I fucking waddled my
way over to the ski lift. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you have your snowboard on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or is it like you're
carrying your snowboard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I had my snowboard on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think you had the one boot in, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh, you had the one boot in? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I had the one boot in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we walked over to like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kind of hobbling like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we walked over
to the beginner ski lift </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was with Sydney and
Meilyne, and Meilyne's partner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meilyne wasn't having
a good time either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Meilyne wasn't
having a good time either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So only one of us knew how to snowboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so only one of us was like
showing us how it was done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And Meilyne knows how to ski, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but this was her first
time trying to snowboard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> either as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So at least I hadn't like a
fellow novice with me, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not the only one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so we walked all
over to this ski lift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so to go through the gates, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we have to like scan ourselves in, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like the problem with
having this big snowboard on you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that once I start like taking a step, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I don't know how to stop, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So there was this fucking
kid in front of me, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was this kid,
fucking pro snowboarder, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like easily goes through the gate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like go through the
gate, take my first step </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I swear to God, I
almost fall on this kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You almost took a kid out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I almost took out
this fucking five year old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Frankly, had it coming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Had it coming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Luckily Mackey just like grabbed me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I fell on this kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At this point I hadn't
even got onto the ski lift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the first step.
- That's the first step. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I think I was on my way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was texting, "How's it going? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> How's it going?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "It's hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really hard." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hard.
- It's fucking hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] And I just saw your head, wee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, when was that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilyne] When you
went down by yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. I tumbled a lot of times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll get to that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really difficult to
fall face first with skis. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause how the fuck
are you gonna do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Snowboarding's very easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's almost guaranteed you're gonna fall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> face first on a snowboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Carry on, carry on,
tell us about your story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I waddle my way to the ski lift. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've never, obviously
this is my first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a ski lift. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never like, I don't know
what the right technique is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like how to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you don't think
about this thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You think, walking, easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One foot forward, next foot forward. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like I was a baby </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to figure out how to walk again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's taking like
all of my mental energy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to figure out how to stay on two feet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then so the person tells me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like go to this point here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where the ski lift is going
to go and like take you up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just thinking, this is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never like panicked
before trying to figure out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how to waddle literally one meter forward. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was pretty bit mean of him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to make you get on a fucking
ski lift first thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You should've just gone,
like walked up the hill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a little bit and just tried to go down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or at least get on the ski lift </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> holding your snowboard, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Can you do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you can do that.
- Yes, you can do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, but clearly no one told
you that you could do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe (indistinct) was
like nah, trial by fire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will be the option I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, yeah, I literally
didn't know that was an option. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Normally, yeah, you are suppose to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with beginners on snowboard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what you make them do is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just kind of make them walk up a hill, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a very, very, like not steep hill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And just kind of make them
like go down straight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like horizontal or perpendicular,
sorry, to the slope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that was very much, wow. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mike is like fuck that,
on the ski lift right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I was kinda like a
animal looking over the edge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, okay, gotta go, gotta go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, don't want to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, let's go now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I'm like, I say a waddle, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this was like me trying
to fucking ice skate over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like one meter ahead of
me and just stay still enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the ski lift to like
lift my butt up and go up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So managed to do that luckily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without any big massive incidents- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then comes the next step. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you get down?
- How do you get off it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was having a great time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, okay, you know what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Look at this view. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Look at this, like I'm
having a great fucking time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like being on a rollercoaster. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, when you're going up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just enjoying
the view, it's peaceful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, okay, I
can get into snowboarding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can get into snowboarding.
- I can get into snowboarding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This is pretty cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I see where the exit is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it gets closer and closer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it slowly dawns on me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do I get off?
- I need to get off this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do I exit this seat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I'm currently sitting on right now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I see the kid in front of me gets off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no problem at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, oh, that looks easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That looks easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just, you know, I just use the momentum </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that the seat is carrying me through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just get off and
just slide off, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like shadow boxing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm just like
visualizing this in my head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, how hard
can this possibly be? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like how hard can this possibly be? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like Garnt in the
shower, psyching yourself up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was literally psyching myself up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, sure, I can do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like if a five-year-old kid
can do it, then I can do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so literally the first
thing that happens is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the lift goes up, it starts slowing down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like brilliant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not even gonna need
to do this at full speed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's going up like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're gonna launch you off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had no idea. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought you just had to
use the momentum to ski off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had no fucking clue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But honestly I think I
would have preferred that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because now I had zero
momentum and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shit, how do I position my feet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And by the time I get to the
point where I need to get off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hadn't figured out
how I was gonna do this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So literally the first
thing that happens is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I put both feet down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I literally tried to-
- Horizontal? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Huh?
- Horizontal? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like that?
- Yeah. Like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was just like, I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - First mistake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like okay, what I'm gonna do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is I'm gonna put both feet down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> twist and they put one of my foot- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - On the snowboard and just lightly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just breezily just like slide down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that, so obviously
that didn't work out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> First, what I did was I
put first two feet down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stood up immediate face plant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because there's
this thing behind you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's pushing you forward </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you're just gonna go boop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you gotta like
shimmy to the side like this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you gotta shimmy like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then kind of go down like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It would be nice if
someone was there to teach me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how it's done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would not have done that to you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Garnt, if I was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have told you how to have done it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, the thing is,
here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We apparently went on the
beginner slope, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The biggest lie.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was no way that this was
the fucking beginning slope. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we found out afterwards
on the second day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause me and Meilyne, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we weren't having a great time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to get down this beginner slope </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and apparently we found on the next day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that there was a slope that was dedicated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like people's first
time trying snowboarding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, we didn't go on that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We went on the fucking beginner slope, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which was people who had
already been experienced enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go down hills.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so it was me
Meilyne, Sydney, and Mackey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at the top of this hill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mackey just fucking bolts
it down already. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- He was screaming at us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "You guys are cowards!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yo, that guy was really fucking funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He was getting like
legitimately frustrated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like bad.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just get good, just get good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was like, "What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just go down, just go down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just go straight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not hard." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And a Mackey goes down first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and tries to like go the
rest of us into going down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, you know what guys? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just gonna go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna do a pro gamer move
and I'm just gonna go down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Immediately start tumbling fucking down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I must have like front flipped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> five fucking times going down- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sounds like fucking "Looney Tunes." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just like, ah, damn, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my mind, I thought snow
is gonna cushion the fall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, man,
this hurts way more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> than I thought it was going to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It does cushion but like 30%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because all of the snow
that you're snowboarding on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> has been like plowed so it's compacted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like jumping off your bed
onto a very flat pillow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like it'll cushion
you, but to what extent? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like, I had
this image in my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's just like oh- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just gonna tumble in! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like falling on clouds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember, because of that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when I first went down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did not hold back as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just like fucking went as fast as I can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not realizing that-
- Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not realizing that I
didn't know how to break. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so quickly I kind of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I learned how to break, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I quickly realized that
the easiest way to break </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just the fall down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, that's what they
teach you at first, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is like to fall down probably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a reason why
like if you start young, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> particularly in skiing and snowboarding, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're going to be really fucking like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're gonna be so much
better than somebody </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who learned later on just
because like when you're a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're fearless.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kids don't fucking know danger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- When I was a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was going way too fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I would just go straight down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was fucking stupid
and that's what like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, this is fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love going like 100 miles per hour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is a good idea.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's how people die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no danger here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But when you're an adult
it's a little harder, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah, because you fall over once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, holy shit, this hurts! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'm not doing
that again. Fuck that! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so Meilyne and Sydney see me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking tumbling down this hill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I look up and Mackey's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, your turn now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they're just like, "No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I don't think I will." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so they start like
getting on their butts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just like-
- Sliding down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And just like slowly sliding down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Mackey's like, "No, come on guys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> come on, get up!
- Just be good! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Not just slide. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Obviously 'cause I learned
young and I was very fortunate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very lucky, very privileged
to be able to learn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how to ski and snowboard at a young age. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The one thing that kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't mind doing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'd rather go
with my friends than not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like it does suck having
to wait like 30, 40 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You go down a slope, it
takes you 30 seconds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you gotta wait 40 minutes for
your friends to come down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you're like, "Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's go on the beginner one, again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's do it again." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So Meilyne and Sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are literally psyching
themselves up on this hill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for like a good, like
40 minutes to an hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were on this beginner hill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was imaging like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, it was like that like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh fuck off, no it wasn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It might have felt like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was probably like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, al I knew was that
I stood up for a second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I started going way faster
than I was comfortable with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's called a hill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause at the
ski resort we were at, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the, like the black diamond, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of them was like only 30 degrees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's not even that bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it wasn't, which is like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So realistically, it was
probably like five degrees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was, okay, I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you can go pretty fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It feels like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when you're not used to that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you can see the bottom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it looks way worse than it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 100%, 100%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anyway, go on.
- I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was the first time
for you so I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The beginning of the
hill was like quite steep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then you go around to the middle part, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is the actual, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I feel was the actual
beginner slope, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause this hill obviously
wasn't even in like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the word I'm looking for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Altitude?
- Slope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Slope angle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Gradient, gradient. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's it, it wasn't equal in gradient. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So the best part to learn
on this beginner hill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like right in like
the middle of this course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, is this the part where he went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in like around like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like did like a loop de loop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So the best part to learn was
actually in the middle part, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which is how I learned how
to like control my speed- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And turn? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and turn because
going down this hill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first time I had two
speeds, it was go and tumble. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was the two speeds that I had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So, while waiting for Sydney and Meilyne </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went on YouTube and started
like looking at some tutorials. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How to snowboard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - On the slope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, on the slope of how to snowboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanted to be that guy
who like slides past you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, what's this guy doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because the thing about Mackey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that he's a good snowboarder, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't think he knows how
to explain how to snowboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I was asking Mackey , </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Mackey , What's the like
the right technique?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he's very much
like, "Oh, just do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Just go, just go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's very much, "Oh you just
go like this and like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you just..." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know that clip of like
that Australian surfer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or not Australia, but just that surfer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who's just like, and it goes
(imitates engine roaring), </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey speaking indistinctly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, that's kind of why I heard, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when Mackey was trying to
explain to me how to snowboard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like, "Oh,
you just go like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you turn like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you control
your speed like this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, "Mackey ,
you're just like showing me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like different angles here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This means nothing to me" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sucks 'cause it's
like you have to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like put your body in the place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where your body doesn't
want to naturally be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, because you have
to put all your weight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in your front foot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which means you're gonna
be leaning into the hill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you lean into it
which you don't wanna do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just naturally, you don't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and then you
gotta like throw your body </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from side to side with your back leg </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is a weird move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you haven't done it before,
it feels really unnatural, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like initially 'cause it's like whoa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and that's why the first time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like after you finished the next day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, you fucking feel that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're using all these muscles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you've never used before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we actually had
the snowboarding trip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like two days, but
I could only go one day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause the second day
you're fucked, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I had never felt
more fucked in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, I feel that, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - On this like beginner slope, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know which fucking
sick fuck decided to do this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was like, that's
funny, but also my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> On this beginner slope, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like this very narrow kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a hill going down, like winding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And at the bottom of
this wind, the exit to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone had put poles like a big X, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was open, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So you could go on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the only way that you
could avoid these poles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was to jump over them in the middle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or go under them, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or go under them, which
you weren't gonna do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause the gap to jump over was
like this, which isn't much, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but when you're a beginner or
even if you're experienced- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your board is not coming off the snow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hard to get, if
you're not experienced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> doing any kind of jump on a snowboard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lifting your board up for a
considerable amount of time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is unnatural and hard to do.
- They're heavy as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's heavy. It's like this, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So there's no way you'll
get, maybe like this, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it was like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Off the ground. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I was like, all right,
"Just jump over it, Garnt." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I went, I jumped over it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my board like just
clipped it a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, oh shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I turn around, Garnt fucking jumps, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just fucking jumps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Face plants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like I knew it was gonna happen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This late in the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> When I was like, I was like starting- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was getting the hang of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like starting to
get the feel of this right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, I went with
the philosophy of just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna fall down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and hopefully I'll learn something new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time I fall down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Trial by fire, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like there's only so many
ways you can fall down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before you figure out a way
to not fall down, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course.
- And so I remember seeing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like I remember seeing these crosses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle of like this course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was going down with Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, I fell down before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "Connor, what do we do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Why do they have these here?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is this?
- Yeah, what is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they're like, "I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Just fucking jump over
or go under it, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just jump over. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like there were two options. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can either like jump over it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or you can like crouch super
low and just go under it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was it's like, you
couldn't really crouch under. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'd have to like
lift them up and stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why they were there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one explained why they were there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they shouldn't have been
there, I'm not really sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess someone just
forgot to put it away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so, it was pretty weird, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was like sick, free jump test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I was like, by the time
me and Connor were going down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was getting confident with myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like going a bit
faster than I was before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, just limit testing myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And just as I did like
this fucking sick turn, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Fuck yes." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a pretty good
turn, it was a good turn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I did I think the first clean turn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of my trip down front. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Going front to like back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and like I
heard Connor being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh dude, fuck yeah, that was clean." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Fuck yeah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I see this X coming up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this pole coming up and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, pro gamer time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna attempt a pro gamer move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let me unlock 100%
of my brain right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I saw Connor do
it and I just had to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw Connor do it and I was
just like you know that scene </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the "Matrix" where
Morpheus just goes back to Neo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and is just like, "All you
need to do is believe." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the jump test. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, "Oh, okay,
Morpheus. I can do this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then I get close, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like immediately realize
I've jumped way too late. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He just jumped into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Instead of like even jumping over it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just fucking jumped straight into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just face-planted, it was so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was basically
just following Garnt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with my face backwards, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he must've been so creeped out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like going backwards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down the slope like this watching him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just checking, make
sure what he was doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then actually watched him go into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so fucking funny.
- Oh, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got Mackey back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I took Mackey down like this
slope that was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh, 'cause they
all stopped and Meilyne quit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "All right,
Mackey , let's go down." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - For the record, Meilyne and Sydney quit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they're weak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilyne] You were
the first one to quit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No! Meilyne, no I wasn't! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meilyne came back the second day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and was like, "I'm returning, guys." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like "Lord of the Rings." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He came back finally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Meilyne did like one slope and was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm done, guys." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then left. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, 'cause Meilyne, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she also had the choice to
snowboard or ski, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And after about like one attempt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> going down this beginning
of slope on the snowboard, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she quits and just tries skiing again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then quit 'cause she was shit at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause she couldn't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Skiing is easy, right guys? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - She was like, "I know how to do it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Couldn't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] I just
don't have the strength. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, that's what they
say, that's what they all say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you couldn't do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If only you had the skis
that first time around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, yeah, I can do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, easy.
- I'm just holding back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't wanna show off, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then Meilyne came back the next day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and was like guys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause she only did like
two slopes on the first day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She was like, "All right,
I'm gonna come back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and do snowboarding again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm ready to try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Did like one thing and then gave up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But at least she did
try again a second time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- So I was impressed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did try again the second day actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I remember so I went
like all out on the first day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I remember I didn't- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't realize how tired I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we went down the
slope like a bunch of times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was there all day.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Took a lot of tumbles on the first day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - As you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was so ready for the second day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm just like, by
the end of the first day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just at the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was getting the hang of it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I was like, fuck
yes, day two. Let's go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I opened my eyes on day two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I felt like I fucking
got punched by Mike Tyson </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I didn't realize
that the thing that hurt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most was my neck.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you've been
hitting your neck a bunch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - From the whiplash probably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I didn't realize
that whiplash was a thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you tumble that much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but now I know that whiplash
is definitely a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should have got a helmet as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They didn't give you one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you weren't wearing helmets? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They didn't give him
one for some reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. that's fucking dangerous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus Christ.
- They didn't give us helmets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, when I saw them without helmets, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, this is a terrible idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could go a whole day without a helmet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like if I was doing like hard stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would be very like, I would not go down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the hard ones that I went down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, if I went again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause last time I went
snowboarding was like fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like six years ago, I would
definitely get a helmet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just 'cause like my body's not used to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't really give a shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was with these guys
on like the green slopes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and blue slopes and I was
like, ah, fuck it, it's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then like if I went down, like I took- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you went down to
like a black diamond- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah, so I took
Mackey down a black diamond. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So everyone had left
and then it was Mackey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the one calling them a coward. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "All right, it's time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's go and it's going to do a real one." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's a double black
diamond, which I wanted to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] To clarify like black diamond </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like the hardest type of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] It's just
like double black diamond </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was just like the most extreme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And I couldn't convince </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> him to do that 'cause I
think he was like, "Oh, no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm good, but I'm not like that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, all right, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love how something about snowboarding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just just turns every guy into a dude bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I can just imagine like
when Garnt did that clean turn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Connor was like, "Yo!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was proud. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like what is it about it
that turns you into a lad? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you want your boys to enjoy it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so that you can come back again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like when I'm bringing my friends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my biggest worry is that they will hate it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from falling over too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they don't want to do it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because then I'm like I
can't bring my friends again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, we can't go to the Alps. You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We can't go to Italy, drink espressos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then hit the slopes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Have a few bevies in
Germany and hit the alps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know? That's what I want to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So and then I was like,
"Yeah, it's just the boys now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Its just me and Mackey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna take him down a black." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I found one that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he definitely didn't want to do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Come on, let's do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on. I'll be fine. I'll be fine." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Knowing Mackey he can't say no, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was like, "Ah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "I wanted to do a harder slope, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but like not this hard." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Oh, it'll
be fine, it'll be fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally like this slope, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't see the bottom of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you can't see over it
until you start going down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's like that steep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then when I started going on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Oh, I think this is closed." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it hadn't been treated at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like all ice, it was
all steep ice, like crevices. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like it was so steep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that when you'd go off a little bit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you would just fall and
hit like a crevice, ice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It took all my fucking
energy to get down this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without falling over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was absolutely exhausted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really get tired when
I go on like blue or red ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I don't really have
to use that much work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can kind of be lazy, but
on the really tough ones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the amount you're turning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to constantly
turn and throw your body </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where the board is like, no, no, no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we can't turn on this, it's too steep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- You have to force it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> otherwise you're going too fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like knackered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I look up and I see Mackie just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he gets up, fucking like
falls over, gets up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> falls over, gets up, falls over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Oh my God,
Meilyne's gonna fucking kill me." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] I was lucky
you didn't have the GPS on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Meilyne thought
I liked killed him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She was like, "Oh my God, oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor's gonna kill him." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause that was
on the second day, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, second day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause like we
went our separate ways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the second day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I woke up, felt
like everything was aching. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Everything felt like shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was just like,
no, I'ma gonna still go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're still pumped, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm still pumped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I really, really
wanted a second day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, oh, easily,
fight through the pain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What? It is just a bit
of muscle ache, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You can get through a bit of muscle ache. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So these guys go off to like
a completely different course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's like two
sides of the mountain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there was like
two sides of the mountain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so these guys go on a
completely different course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just be left to my own devices </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and by the end of this day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to conquer this beginner hill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I felt like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Lift too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So Sydney had given up by then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everyone else was on this other hill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And on the second day it was
actually like almost empty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> compared to the first day
'cause the first day was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think like, it was
like a Sunday, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or like a Saturday? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it must've been. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like a public holiday I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the second day wasn't a public holiday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like the slopes were like almost empty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like perfect conditions as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like a shit ton of snow
and it was perfectly clear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sun was out. It was like, perfect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nice, nice.
- So that was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I get up to the beginners
slope on the second day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everything aching as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, it's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All I need to do is like tumble once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'll just like fight
through the pain and you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get it over with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like I go down, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I start going down this beginner hill, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get further than I did yesterday- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gotten more used to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I tumble and
I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, you know, I expect this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like I tumbled and I landed
with my head like downhill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like I was like downhill like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I quickly realized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, how do I get up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause my neck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my neck muscles were not
working at that point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I could not lift my
neck to go like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was not only like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was lifting it not only like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even when I was like perfectly flat, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was hard enough to lift my neck up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I was going against the hill as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to lift my neck up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I quickly realized I
couldn't lift my neck up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I quickly realized how heavy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my gear that I was wearing was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause what I would
do is just, if I'm face down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just bring my board,
I do like a flip back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can do a flip, but
you can also kind of just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like around turn your body around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like shimmy your way around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you wanna be faster, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can just fucking throw your legs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and just stamp it into the snow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I did not have enough
ab strength at that time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like lift my board up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how much like how much
like my everything was achy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> - Don't forget that you
came from your dad's balls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This is on script, everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was the best load my dad ever shot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Back to the fucking video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I kind of realized quickly I
was in a little bit of a pickle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I didn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how I was going to get up
with all this heavy gear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So what I tried doing is
just like slowly shimming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what was I-
- Shimming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shimming my body to be like horizontal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or something where I could get up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That took ages. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I must've been there for
like 40 minutes, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one helped you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, that's the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was there for like a good 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'd gotten around like
I'd say about 20 degrees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I saw someone upside down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would go over and be
like, "Yo, you good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Homie, you good?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So after about 20 degrees, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like someone skis down
and says, "Are you okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you need any help?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like (panting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, I'm okay. I think I got this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So he goes, "Okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he offers me a hand
and so I get up and I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, he helps me sit back up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so I sit back up and he goes back over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, okay, I got this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I try shimming a bit more, slip, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like my body slips a bit and
I'm like back on my back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I had never known
how it felt to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, when you see like
a tortoise on their back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah..
- And they can't get back up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's exactly how I felt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One with nature, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so I find after another 20 minutes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I finally get to the point where my feet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like I'm feet first downhill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like fuck this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I take off the snowboard and I walk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I walked the rest of the way down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I am not going through
that experience again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will do whatever it takes
to not take the board off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I will do- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, that's what I thought, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm just like, it took
me literally 40 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just hate admitting defeat
and taking my board off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's nothing sadder
than just like walking down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> while everyone's just (imitates
swooshing) past you, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a depressing day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But if you have to do
it, you have to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's crazy like everyone
snowboards in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In Europe, everyone skies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Japan.... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, for some reason- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And no one was helmets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one wears helmets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's scary.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the rental place
didn't even offer it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, that's I- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like an option you have to ask for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's nuts and I was like,
"You don't offer helmets?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I got like the rental pack, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which was apparently like
the all-inclusive pack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they just, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Clearly not all inclusive, is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, like a beginner, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> even like professionals wear helmets, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly.
- You never know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what could happen, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause fucking, what was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Michael Schumacher fell
and hit a rock, didn't he? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he's in a
vegetative state now I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Is he? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he was a really experienced skier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, he just hit a rock. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess nobody told me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I wish I... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I turned up and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh God, they don't have helmets." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Scary.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish I had worn a helmet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I could go the second
day without feeling like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It would help with your neck as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you wouldn't be like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I wouldn't be like fucking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would it or would it just be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like extra weight on your head? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, "Oh, God!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, 'cause I feel
like that extra distance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you go that the helmet cushions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Definitely helps.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also though, dude, skiing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then being able to
get like a fat ramen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a curry, oh damn, that's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, like that onsen you go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> after a full day of snowboarding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the best fucking feeling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It is the best sleep you'll have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Onsen in this place,
was just like a view </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of just like the ski slopes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it was like an outdoor onsen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where you just viewed the mountains. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they like
refurbished it all as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, you could feel
like the snow coming down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Take me back, man. Take me back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, hopefully I'll be able
to join you guys this year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Hell yeah. Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Dude, I want to ski so
God damn much this season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I haven't done nearly as much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as I wanted to when I came here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking dude, again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I haven't gone snowboarding or skiing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in like five years.
- Yeah and it's suppose to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like some of the best skiing
in the world in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some of the slopes I walked
on is fucking insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would just want an experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I'm not on my ass for
literally 90% of the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That would be a cool
experience for me, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, also just after
you're all like sore, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you all go the onsen
then you go for the meal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get a bunch of beers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, it's so good, dude.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The after ski beer or
snowboarding is just like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 100%.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like how long did it take
you to learn snowboarding? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I always did skiing's
'cause my parents took me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They do like the whole package holidays. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking hated skiing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you'd ski in
like groups with like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'd go to like Bulgaria
where it's like dirt cheap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like do it and you'd
have to be in a group </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of other families. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I didn't really enjoy it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was like the rebellious kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I wanted to do my own thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you have to like go
and like follow along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and so I'd say it took me like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I got like good enough
to go on any slope skiing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like three weeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I taught myself how to snowboard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because once you've
gotten the grasp of skiing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very easy to kind of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're already used
to the lack of friction- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was still really difficult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's still hard, it's still hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it like didn't
make sense in my head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nothing can prepare you for
just how snowboarding works, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it really goes against everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your mind has trained you for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, especially the
difference between like skiing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and snowboarding, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like in skiing it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're facing down the hill, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you're gonna go and if you're not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you've stopped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the literal opposite
with snowboarding, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You need to be facing the side
to go and this way you stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you know, the thing
that made me want to change </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really badly was that I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure anyone who skis will know this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the shoes are just fucking awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Ugh, the worst, the worst. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Concrete blocks on your feet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, 'cause we were doing like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm really very grateful that my parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> took me on these like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were like the cheapest
skiing holidays you could get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so we often stayed really,
really far away from the places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and you'd have to put your ski shoes on- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Kind of look like clown shoes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so you put these
shoes on like 10 minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before you'd like, 10
minute walk from the bus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So you have to walk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like 13 with my skis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not that strong yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Walking 10 minutes with my
skis in these horrible things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> click, clop, click, and
then have to wait on the bus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for 20 minutes and you have to walk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> another like five minutes
and it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hate these shoes so god damn much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so painful wearing them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything about these suck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They absolutely destroy your ankles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and then I was like,
I don't care what it takes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna learn to
snowboard for those God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you just get boots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the first time I was
snowboarding boots, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I can walk normally!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you're at the restaurant, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you see these people with their trays </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like clopping with their
skis with their food on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like move out the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Chad snowboarder boots here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Runs past! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, don't
mind me, just getting a beer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll take that, thank you very much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Its like you just get so much more freedom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's so much chiller,
like I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You haven't got poles to carry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so that's why I wanted to learn it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking sucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> First three days, I
just kept falling over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh yeah, same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Me and my little brother
did it at the same time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and my little brother sprained
his ankle like first day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, no, I'm determined. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say snowboarding the
first week that I did it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was pretty shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I could go down a black slope by the end, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was doing it really badly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like going like
this, you know, really slowly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like I went down it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'd say it took me like maybe two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or three more weeks before I felt like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was actually doing it good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hmm.
- Yeah, I was self taught. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I mean it's just
about like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just getting your body used
to those weird movements that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and going fast, speed.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But also it's just like just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just have to commit to some of these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you just have to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I know this is not what
I'm supposed to do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I have to do this.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's scary, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like leaning forward on a hill, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like you're not built for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Your brain's not built to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your brain's not built to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know this thing
you're going down fast? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You gotta lean forward.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Into the danger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I always felt when I was skiing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you go fast, when you're skiing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I almost feel like it's like
safer than going slower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, weirdly- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It felt safer because like the way that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how it worked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but when I was going snowboarding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I started getting speed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it did not feel like secure at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's wobbling and anything
that hits the board underneath, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you feel it a fuck ton when
you're going really fast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It is fucking terrifying.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And if you tumble when
you're going like really fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just fucking
tumbling all over the place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it's like some "Looney Tunes" shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And also like tumbling with
just these massive things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on your feet, it never
feels natural, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like having two concrete bricks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like glued to your feet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the green army man, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just kind of learn, just of like do this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then hopefully you fall good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just don't put your hands out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the hardest part is learning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you fall naturally, you
want to put your hands out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's when you sprain your ankles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not ankles, your wrists.
- Your wrists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can get like the wrist guards, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but they don't help that much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, what I got taught, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I got taught by like
a professional snowboarder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and he said like, "When you fall, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like you have to fall with your fists, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause If you fall like
this it goes back." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just don't do that.
- He did that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and broke both of his
wrists at the same time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So he's like, "Don't do
that, that shit hurts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can tell you firsthand." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just put my arms like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you just fucking
do this then you're good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Just don't fall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just get good, right?
- Why would I fall? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, literally what I
found from snowboarding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is that it's literally the
get good of sports, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're being taught by Mackey, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just don't be a pussy and just get good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean like when I
started getting used to it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was nothing that
could prepare my mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, you know, I watch YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I watched the YouTube tutorials, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried to follow what they were saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but nothing could really prepare me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for just like getting
the feel of the snowboard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's like you've got to shut off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a part of your brain and
relearn another skill set </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're like snowboarding and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and also like just
while you're putting pressure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on your toes and your,
like the exact point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can determine so much
on how you're steering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You get so much more controlled
once you realize like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I just have faith, I put pressure here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it'll turn where I want it to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But you kind of got to like
not panic to learn that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, panicking is what
fucks you up the most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It's good though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, if you ever get
the chance to go, go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but obviously-
- Honestly, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like it is a
very privileged sport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing)
- It is. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We've been talking about a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of privileged activities, haven't we? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like kayaking and snowboarding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember when I was at the ski resort </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I phoned my mom said to tell her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I was like snowboarding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she was like, "Oh,
you rich now, are you?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause to me, like snowboarding and skiing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has always been like the rich man's sport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's always been like the
white man's sport, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - White man's sport. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck, fuck.
- That's how I was raised up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like view snowboarding
and skiing because you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I go on holiday, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I visit back home and everything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I go to like a nice cheap beach </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever in Thailand or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Snowboarding and skiing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the only reason I'd never gone before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was because there seems
to be like so many steps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so much equipment that you need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in order just to go down a slope. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of like golfing, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I was about to say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's two types of
rich white man sports. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's you either go skiing and
snowboarding or you play golf. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I think I saw something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if this is true at all, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I saw something and it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like based on like
sports or accidents in general, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what percentage of them were white people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was like the whitest
accident you can have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is on a fucking jet ski. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't remember where it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like 99.5% of accidents on jet skis </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were white people.
- White people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then the next one was
skiing and snowboarding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course.
- It had like 97 or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's nothing more
white than a jet ski. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was gonna say when
you put it like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, I don't think
there is anything whiter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than owning a jet ski. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's the whitest thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you ever been on a jet ski? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you thought about
going on a jet ski? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd like to.
- I'd like to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who the fuck owns a jet ski? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't live in like
Florida or shit like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been on a jet ski. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fun as fuck.
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because I mean, in Thailand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously with the beach and everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's some services where
you can rent out a jet ski </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for like a half an hour or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, it's basically
just a motorbike on water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you jump off it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you do a sick trick? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - SSX on a jet ski.
- You do any flips? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whoa!
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean, it's just a lot of fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I could see how people get
injured on that though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You go pretty fast and
you think that it's water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it doesn't hurt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Water's like hitting concrete. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
- Yeah. You think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You think that falling
off at full speed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't hurt, but it fucking hurts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's a lot of fucking fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I haven't done much on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I've only had like
half an hour on a jet ski </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a beach in Thailand once,
but that's pretty much it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like that's all I need. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like, "You know
what? Now I'm done." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've fulfilled the white man experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll tell you that this like
ski resort that we stayed at, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like, its theme, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like its theme was like,
it was very like inspired </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by I guess like American culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds so bizarre. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> A Japanese ski result
inspired by Americans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - By American culture.
- Yeah, it's really weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like kind of what I imagined, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what I imagine a ferry would be like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, it had a lot of different, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of different things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 1950s carnival style, I'd say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Oh weird, in Japan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - In Japan.
- Whereabouts did you guys go? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hokkaido.
- Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But there was some areas of this hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that were like totally normal, chill, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's a big area that
was like kid's theme park. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Carnival theme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was really weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It was really fucking bizarre.
- So they had like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> these animatronics, animals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, like some Chuck E. Cheese shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like some Chuck E. Cheese shit, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I don't know when they had
bought these animantronics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I don't know when they had
bought these animantronics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we were just, me and
Sydney were just sitting there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and they play these like songs, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They'd have these like
animatronic concerts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in this like children's area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can buy fucking
burgers and fries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like an eating area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was full on Chuck E. Cheese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck?
- Yeah. Basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And these poor employees had to listen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to these fucking things sing all day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and so, me and
Sydney were just enjoying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a nice burger and
everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Other than this fucking
animatronic dog or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just starts bigging up the Confederacy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> me and Sydney had to
double-take to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> did we just hear that correctly? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what is going on right now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause I walked past them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like doing my own thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like why they're wearing
Confederate soldier uniforms? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dead ass.
- Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So after we heard that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we took like a closer look
at these animatronics, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> To be like what is going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When did they buy these and
where did they buy these from? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we saw one of the bears was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was very, let's say not very tasteful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 1920s black cartoon character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no.
- Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The lips were like massive, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it had the stereotypical
cartoon black man accent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with like 1920s, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the whole, like I don't even... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's literally if you go
and watch a Disney cartoon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from the 1920s with a black person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with that like kind of
like stereotypical accent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they gave them and
character, it was just that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, oh no, oh no, oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't make that shit up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - These poor Japanese tourists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are just like, "Ah,
American culture. Yeah!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Kids are jut like running
around being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Mama, what's the Confederacy?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yes, Meilyne's got a fucking video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you show it to Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nothing weirder than that thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> standing next to Miku. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like is that a Miku scene? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] It was but I... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh no! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, that is ugly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a really good resort though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really cheap, good onsen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a really good resort. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really good resort but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Despite that, fantastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is one of those things
you're like, "This is great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What is going on here?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is this a thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why is this here?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like you have your 90 year old aunt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who has that one piece of memorabilia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're like, "Auntie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you should probably throw that away." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should probably not talk about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
You should probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> get rid of that I think.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, to give them
the benefit of the doubt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think that anyone there knew. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's the matter of like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when tourism comes back in, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's been there for decades. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, clearly. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How has no tourists come up and been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "You know what that is, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's probably not a good idea." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I wanted to
think of like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because obviously in the
past five, six years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's been a very hot topic.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's only now where we've
really started to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we should probably get
rid of all that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's not a good idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I wonder through, I wonder, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has anyone send them an
email, letting them know like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, love the
animatronics. They're great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're really great." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "The dog is cute but." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Maybe we should kind of
change up the theme a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We got a bunch of Miku's
probably lying around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We could probably reservice them." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That picture of the
Miku next to the dog. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, that is some
cursed shit right there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That looked photoshopped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking.... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't want to like
swear off this place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it was, you
know, I'm sure, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There had to be a
reason behind it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a nice place
and I really did feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like they were just like
ignorant, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, it kind of felt like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they had just like
brought some memorabilia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from America, they didn't
know what they were buying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I mean this is Hokkaido, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot of the fucking ski resorts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are in the middle of nowhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's in the
middle of fucking nowhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They have no idea about
anything like what's going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It makes sense but it's still not good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was just super fucking weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because you walk into this-
- Yeah, it was really bizarre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You walk into this- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the last thing you expected to see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the middle of fucking nowhere in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Because we had to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we got to go on a coach that
lasted about two, three hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the middle of fucking Hokkaido, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So we were going in the middle
of nowhere and we walk in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just like old American
memorabilia everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It was so fucking bizarre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was massive as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> The hotel part was really fancy as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like the entrance to
this hotel was like marble, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like pure marble with like pillars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so fancy you can get a helicopter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the airport to the hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking hell.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then they just had this whole thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then also, I mean,
completely unrelated, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was really offended when I bought a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what was it, advertised as a coffee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I paid $3 for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like okay, it's not
the most expensive coffee, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was like, all right,
fine, paid $3 for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally dead I saw this woman </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put a fucking shitty pod into a machine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then click coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "I don't want it anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was it a Nespresso?
- Was it a Nespresso at least? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't even an Nespresso. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was some budget version of Nespresso. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like what is this?
- I can't believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, if it's a Nespresso, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe I'd pay $3 for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not even a Nespresso. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's like the bare minimum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're charging for a coffee, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, I'm not expecting much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like if you're gonna put
the pod in fucking front of me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like literally just get the
pod in front of me, boom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right in front of my coffee. Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? I was like I
don't wanna drink this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get this acid water out of my face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor showing his privilege clearly here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's a pod, get it out of my face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've become spoiled
on coffee to the point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I just can't like
drink the shit stuff anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like instant coffee, the
thought of drinking that now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the one in the tubs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Nescafe ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh fuck, dude, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm showing my privilege.
I don't even care, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If showing my privilege means </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't have to drink that again, gladly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Look at you, not
drinking instant coffee, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> going snowboarding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The true rich white man experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not privileged, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's called fucking taking care of myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not putting that fucking
dirt water acid into my body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're still drinking
instant coffee, I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're desperate, I always
have it in the cupboard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If I'm desperate, I have
nothing else, I'll do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if that's your like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can't wait for my morning cup of coffee." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Puts acid in the hot water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, don't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're worth more than that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't enable these companies
to sell this garbage shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they call coffee, it's not coffee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Rant over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ted Talk.
- Would you drink it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I don't drink it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Back me up here, boys. What the fuck!? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you kind saying what I thinking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the stage is all yours, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let the white man, fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, let the privileged white man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who just came back from
snowboarding say it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just didn't come
back! It's fucking May! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where am I gonna snowboard!? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, 'cause like the worst part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like staying in a hotel, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Is just knowing that you're
gonna have to like drink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that shitty instant three-in-one coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You mean that shitty coffee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have at the ryokan as well? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At camping?
- Oh God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't remind me, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So there's this coffee
machine in the ryokan, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. Hold up though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The fact that there's a
coffee machine in a ryokan,, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is already.... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's normally no coffee
to be found in these places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, usually there isn't, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So all of us, when we walked in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we saw that and the guy was like, "Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so for people who are staying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get free coffee at
the coffee machine." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone's like,
"Perfect. That's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Tomorrow morning's going to be fantastic." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Walk up and my first red flag was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like "Free coffee." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, make me pay, please make me pay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is nothing scarier
than something that's for free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I was going to be like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tea, (indistinct) that's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like it's a machine
that serves coffee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you press the button </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you could hear beans grinding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm just like, surely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surely there must be some quality to this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if I can hear something
whirring in the machine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not just a pod or
something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I get this coffee, I drink it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd never thought I would ask for a refund </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a free coffee, but I'm
kind of considering it now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How was it so bad though
if it's like grounded coffee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if there's beans- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I don't know if
it was grounded coffee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They're might've just been like beans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just whirling in a container. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure they just grounded dirt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they sold it as coffee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause that's what it fucking tasted like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure those were rocks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that were being ground
up like from the dirt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they dug up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like how some vacuums
have like speakers in them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to have like sounds play
when you pick up stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like to make it sound more-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was not fresh coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If it was beans, those
beans have been there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> since those animatronics have been there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Once you grind the beans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they go bad like within like, oh God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe like a few weeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, clearly the people
at the hotel didn't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, well, I mean,
once they're in the machine, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're good to go, aren't they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, beans, they get
pretty bad pretty quickly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why it's just like
grind them when you drink them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But clearly they didn't
think about that though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, well, there you go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Unlimited supply of
coffee right here for you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fine people staying at our hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, I will happily
be called privileged </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for just wanting good coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll take it. I'll take it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I remember like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The most acceptable form of privilege. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, okay, so
if I'm privileged, fine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not a peasant then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As long as I'm not a peasant, fine, fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like I remember
like I've grown up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my entire life on instant coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like my childhood was my parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like drinking instant coffee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with powdered Coffee Mates, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was just my entire life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember, like after
I finished university, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had my first job, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I tried try getting a coffee
machine for the first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember the first thing
my mum and dad said to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was like, "Oh, you don't
need a coffee machine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We got fucking Nescafe right here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just it's cheap." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so easy.
- "It's easy, grind it up." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mother, I respect myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm not putting that dirt in my body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So one year I buy them for like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was, I can't
remember if it was Christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or one of their birthdays, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buy them a coffee machine, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, "Mum, Dad, try this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just try it. Just give it a try." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just give it a go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And now every few weeks or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just like, "Son,
we need more pods., </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Son, where do we buy the pods?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is so much better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like night and day
how much better it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a lot more expensive obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I'm looking
forward to in my new place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause my old place, I
didn't have enough space </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for a Nespresso machine, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like, fuck the
curtains, fuck the couches, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck the beds, Nespresso machine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is the first thing
on my list right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I said this on the live stream, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could lose my house and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can I keep the coffee
machine at least though?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If my house catches on fire, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm taking the Nespresso machine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you save, your gaming PC, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all your life's work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nah, I'm grabbing the coffee machine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At least I can watch my house burn down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with a nice cup of coffee.
- With a nice cup of coffee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - With a nice tasting espresso. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck me.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, I wish we did bring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a coffee machine on camping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck the TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean that's what the
power outlet was for, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you got a power outlet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why would you not bring... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Fucking plug it in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's what the
power outlet was for honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Plug it into Garnt's fucking
monstrosity of a generator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and bring an espresso machine with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Bring the milk frother too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And bring the milk,
put it in a mini fridge, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> connect the mini fridge
to your thing as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can just imagine, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I step out of my tent, I'm like ah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I hear like (buzzing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I look over at
someone else's camping lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I see them with an espresso machine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd be like, you fucking
10,000 IQ mother fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hate you so much right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he fucking froths the milk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "God damn it!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God, I wish that was me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bringing a TV, weak shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Bringing your own espresso
machine and milk frother, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's big brain, bro.
- That is big brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really the big brain stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The thing about
camping, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like most food you cook on camping, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it tastes good, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's something about the camping cook </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that gives you the taste to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's something about
just cooking something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on an open fire that
just makes it be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> your caveman brain just activates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ad you're just like, "This tastes good." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bacon on campfire is like next level. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Any meat on campfire is like legendary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The only thing that is just
never translated is coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Coffee, like camping coffee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just like the most, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally the headset meme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of the guy ripping it
off, campfire coffee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like. (sighs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because let's be honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Camping is basically
just homeless simulator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like a few days, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like privileged homeless simulator. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you guys ever seen
a homeless person before? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like homeless simulator
with a savings account. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, trying to get us speed
run canceled over here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, by the homeless community? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I mean, you're
basically going homeless </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for a few days in the
middle of the field. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you got a tent, you
have a fucking power outlet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Name one homeless person
with a power outlet, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I'm not saying in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, not in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just saying normally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like have you seen... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think homeless people are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm homeless, I'm gonna
retreat to the mountains." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's not what they fucking do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because they don't have a fucking tent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they're homeless. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God.
- That's Skid Row. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, this is getting a bit off topic, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean, yeah, I've seen
some homeless people have tents. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do they not have tents? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They do. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They do and it depends
where you are though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, Skid Row, everyone
has a fucking tent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they're all camping.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're not fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Trash Taste canceled.
- I'm just joking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just joking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We apologize if any of these
jokes are very tasteless, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which they probably are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They probably are, it's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But no. What was I saying? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt's homeless simulator. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was homeless simulator. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like there's nothing that has made me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just like feel more like... (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you gonna say you feel grateful? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel grateful that I
have a roof over my head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are so fucking white right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel grateful that I
have a roof over my head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and that I have a coffee machine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I spent one day in
the outdoors with a tent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with a power outlet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey grunting) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm so grateful that I have all this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't a tent. It
wasn't a power outlet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was the coffee, which was
what I was trying to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So if you want to feel grateful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for your coffee machine, go camping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I said that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that would come off as
10 times more privileged </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than if Garnt said it.
- Oh, come on! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You've said something
like that before anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure he said
something five minutes ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so what? I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm tired of pretending
to be a peasant, frankly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's never what I aim to be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember when I was younger, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the moment I realized I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this peasant life isn't for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like 10 years old. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 10 years old!? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't fucking know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Arbitrary age of young age.
- Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We went on a plane
somewhere and I was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow, already privileged,
you get to go on a plane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's not fucking, oh, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like fucking Ryanair, it's
hardly a fucking privilege. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You ever been on the EasyJet, Joey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the furthest thing from privilege. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like a layover or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then so this was like a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a flight that was
going to like Australia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it stopped in where we
were going to, Amsterdam, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's like a two hour flight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember we were sitting
in an economy and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Mum, what did they get
to go in the really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really cool looking one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They get to lie down." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, "Oh, 'cause
that's really expensive." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Why
don't you pay for it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "We can't afford it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "what do you
mean you can't afford it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just get a good bank account. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, "You guys
have a job. Right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, "Yeah,
we can't afford it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's too expensive." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Oh, well." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you were my kid, I would've
slapped you over the head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I was just asking, I
was like, "How much is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how much
it is. How does it work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm young as fuck,
don't know how much it costs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I have no notion of this before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "Well, how much is it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How much and why can't you afford it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you're telling me that
those people over there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> have enough money for it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nah, that's not right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If they can get it, I can get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was like my mindset. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's how I've always been in life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, if someone else can have it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can have it, why can't I have it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Why not? Why not? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If they get it, why don't I? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a person too.
- I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> did you think like that as a kid? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I always thought if someone
else could do it, I could do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I was like 10 all
I thought it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Thank you father for buying
me a packet of Mentos." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, I was grateful,
but I would always wonder, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you never wondered why those other people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who had like all this stuff- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wondered but I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, the fact that
we're not there right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> means that they're different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? They're the same as us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They just got lucky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck that! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what they want you to believe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they want you to believe
they have like 10,000 IQ, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we earned this, fuck off, no they didn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They got fucking lucky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck off, no you didn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You made a few good decisions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you made an air conditioning
company, good for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - How to get privileged? Just get lucky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a lot of luck involved. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, there is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is mostly luck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 90% of the people in that first class </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking born into wealth, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's bullshit.
- That is true, that is true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not fair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the same rich people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> giving each other their kids money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, fuck that! I deserve that! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why don't I deserve that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna have some of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's wrong with having that mindset </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of being like, if they can
do it, why can't I get it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, there nothing wrong
with having that mindset. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's nothing wrong
with having that mindset. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just funny that you were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> having that mindset like at age 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally. Yeah, like from a young age. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You were just trying to be a pro gamer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - From a young age, - I always was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just wondered like, why, why can't- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why aren't my parents
mid-maxing life right now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just always thought if
someone else could do something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always from a young age, if
they could do it, I could do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, that's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a great mentality to have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> When it's talking about,
you know, like privilege. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well it's because money's
like a taboo subject, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't say that you
want to get a lot of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I always just think that like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like everyone wants to
have a lot of money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But no one wants to admit that, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People don't want to
admit that they're like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, people are always
like, "If I had that," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they're never like,
"I'm gonna go for it," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's embarrassing
admitting to your friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, "I'm gonna be a millionaire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna go for that shit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it sounds, you're
like all right, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, all right.
- All right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> go back to Walmart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Shut the fuck, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, nah, dude, fuck that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let people try if they want to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Man, let 'em fuck up.
- Absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're gonna go
bankrupt, do it before 30 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you can at least like
fix your shit, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw a thing that was like most people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most impactful years in your life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are like 40 years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the people who do
the important things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or the CEOs of the
company, all that stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's when you're 40. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So just fuck up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Try and do a bunch of shit.
- Yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly.
- Go for gold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're like 20, why the fuck not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Take some risks while you're young. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, honestly like what I
try to tell people is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially those in their mid 20s, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I feel like
everyone hits the mid 20s, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like 23, 24 where they realize, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna be working
for the rest of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And everyone gets their first job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get excited getting your first job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, "Damn, I'm
actually getting paid for once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not a peasant anymore." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because let's be honest, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being a student is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what the system
wants you to think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Being a student is just like, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you've just gotten used to
living like a peasant, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like yes, this is normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember like somewhere in my mid 20s </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when I just realized, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how the fuck did I just live off cup ramen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a good like five years of my life? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not normal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've just like internalized
that to be like, dude, dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Night out versus cup ramen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Night out anytime.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Got to get your priorities right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but then you realize, wow, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have a job with a disposable income. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can have like a decent living. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's what you would hope
that most people would have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if they went through university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if they got an education. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a lot harder now.
- Oh yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was lucky enough to
get even my first job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after I graduated from uni, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which a lot of people have
a hard time doing now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I will say if you are
able to be in a position </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can give yourself a
safety net, then by all means, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fuck up in your 20s, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because your 20s are the best point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can fuck up in life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and still it not be the end of the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you still have
enough time to recoup, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, you know, get
back to ground zero. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I was just
like, I was like fuck it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I'll try YouTubing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's probably a terrible idea to lose two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or three years of my possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long engineering career to this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But I was like fuck it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna try it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like why wouldn't I try it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it'd be stupid for me not to try it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Go for gold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I mean, it does get to a point where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I mean- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, if I went down
the engineering path, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure you too, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> eventually in your 40s, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd probably have a very cushy wage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You'd be very well off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'd be very comfortable, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You'd have a very nice, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd be able to afford
very fine things in life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you become a chartered engineer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The pay you get is very good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And when you work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in certain places where the engineering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gets more difficult or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you can start getting nutty money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I was just like, yeah, fuck that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd rather take 20K a year
doing something that I like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that also has the chance to
make way more down the line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's what I was always like though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always thought why settle? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would rather risk losing it all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to make a million dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then just settle for like, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] A comfortable
amount, right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because to me it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I can do that at any point in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can settle down and do things smartly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because you never
know with our career, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it could start happening
tomorrow for all we know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like if you become the
biggest fucking YouTuber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the planet next week,
dude, you're set for life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like, but I don't
even think of it like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like how I see YouTube anyway, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I would just rather
risk and do something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's kind of like oh,
could lose it all, hehe, XD. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Could just become homeless tomorrow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Better start camping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right? Better start
getting good at camping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, I mean I'd rather try it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah, fuck it, why not?
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think it's important </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like recognize that some people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are just not in the
position to be able to try. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was very lucky that
I built up the savings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I also had a really
good family that set me up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to allow me to do that, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like I will say this right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I was never brought
up, like my family weren't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the best of financial positions at all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like I was lucky enough
to have a mom and dad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who work their fucking asses
off to like get me through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and give me a better
opportunity than they ever had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's why like right
now I'm trying to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of everything I earn
I like spend on them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I spend more on them than I do on me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like it's
my way of like paying back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the opportunity that they gave me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Such a good boy.
- Yeah, I mean- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Such a good son. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean dude, like yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, my parents
like, especially my dad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he came up from like
fucking poverty almost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in fucking Thailand and somehow
found his way to England </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and worked his fucking ass off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had a much harder life
than I ever went through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So of course, I'm like fucking, dad- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't that fucking bad ass though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like he had a dream, move to England, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then his son's like engineering degree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and now he talks about anime titties, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That part of the story- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was not what I was expecting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That part of the story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he doesn't tell that at
his family gatherings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nah, he's fucking proud now, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's such bad ass, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I feel like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a fallacy where
you think money solves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> every problem that you have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Money does not solve- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It makes like significantly easier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And it sounds so privileged </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you say that, but like, no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as someone who hasn't
been poor in her life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> money doesn't solve every problem, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but there is a point in your life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where money is 90% of
your problems, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- And once- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, when money is your problem, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't really have time to think about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything other than money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly and like my
mentality when I was a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was just, I just want to get
by and be like comfortable, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know?
- Same, same, same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like that was
my big driving force </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like really try to be successful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and to take risks is just 'cause </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just tired of just not knowing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what my life situation would
be five years down the line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, how the fuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> am I gonna take care of my parents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they get old? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was a big fucking thing for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was definitely a time
when I was like 16 to like 18 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I thought I really love video games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really care what job I get. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to be able
to play games after work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I genuinely I thought I wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like a few years.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then when I went to university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it like very much kicked in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I don't think I can do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an eight hour job a day I hate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- I think I can't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did a three month internship to know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that I don't want to do this
for the rest of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, more
power to people who love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that line of work.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was jealous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At the time I was so jealous of the people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that loved my course
and what we were doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I felt like they
were just so OP with school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They like got through it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they got all the good opportunities
because they enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I just didn't enjoy
it, I couldn't try, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I just didn't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I have so much respect for people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who can go to their nine to five job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, "Yeah, this is fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - At the time when I didn't
know what the fuck I was doing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was so jealous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, fuck man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish I knew what the fuck I was doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right?
- You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm sure for every
person like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I got very lucky and I
found something that I loved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that just luckily makes money somehow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My mom disbelieves that it
did for a very long time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but someone it makes money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think all parents did
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Somehow it makes money, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know, I'm sure for every one of me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that got very lucky, there
was probably 10 people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who've never really found what they liked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just had to like kind
of just be like, "All right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well I gotta get a job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't do nothing all my life." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly.
- It sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think one thing I've realized more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as I've grown older is that as a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we were sold this idea that
there's only really one way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your career path can go, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like education, university, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get a job to do with your degree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and your career progresses from there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's like, I had that mentality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like the longest time of my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And now like the older I've gotten, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more people I've met </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who have had like the
weirdest fucking career paths. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, Ladybeard.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've had a lot of those
people on the podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like in the
entertainment industry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you do meet the people who
kind of are just bouncing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from things to things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're just try to figure
out what they want, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just trying to enjoy life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not even in entertainment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like living in Japan as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like meeting like teachers who
have like found opportunities </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just randomly, like sometimes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like what I'm trying to
say is that as a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was, you know, we got
put this pressure on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that by the time you go to university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or by the time you finish high school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you need to know what you want to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the rest of your life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wish they didn't
fucking tell me that lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's bullshit.
That is 100% bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is the biggest
lie of the fucking world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel, especially when
you're a young adult, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the biggest lie of the fucking world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is thinking that once
you start a career path, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're gonna have to stick on this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like the majority of your life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's such a fucking lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And like another big lie is thinking that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to go to fucking
university or college </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to have to have a decent career. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's also a fucking lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There are so many different career paths </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are available to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is not just higher education, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because as an Asian, I was taught that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I don't do higher education,
I'm a fucking failure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I don't get that
A, I failed as an Asian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not even talking
about being a YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause obviously we are very lucky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be able to be YouTubers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Absolutely.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not even talking about like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, we're YouTubers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a different career path I found. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I've met like so many other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who have like just found random jobs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, fucking Meilyne </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> found her fucking job through Craigslist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is about just trying and looking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and just being at the right
place at the right time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and making sure you take every opportunity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that comes your way.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I just say yes to everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You miss every opportunity you don't take. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, man.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And if you, which is in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is something that I
just did read and enjoy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like the culture of you go to work, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you go to the pub and that's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you never try and
do any self improvement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You never try and like look
for any other opportunities. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like looking for another
job is like, oh wow, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what's wrong with you?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like there are so many
opportunities out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for different jobs that you
like never even thought about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> until it's just on your lap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like have we ever talked
about Kenny before? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like your friend? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I haven't talked about Kenny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What he's doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. Kenny's my friend
who's lives in Niigata. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's a crazy guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He's great. I love him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's amazing. He's so funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's really, really rich. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He is a proper lad, he is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he's up in Niigata
in the middle of Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's half Japanese, half Welsh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's just a fake priest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think I've spoken on it before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that my friend's a fake priest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like he teaches English </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he's also a fake priest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's just what he likes doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But he also just doesn't really care about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being in one place for too long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, I'll just kind of go wherever- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just a wanderer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He literally just goes places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's like, "All
right, what's going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's figure it out. Let's
try and get a job here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- He just doesn't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have a friend who is
similar to that who lives here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I couldn't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But he's bad ass, he just turns up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and does what he wants, it's great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's always super
happy and super optimistic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, "Are you
British? Are you really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You grew up in the UK, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How are you this optimistic?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the Japanese side that's kicking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he just turns up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Yeah, what's going on?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Always has a good time,
talks to anyone he meets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel people like that are usually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the most optimistic
people in the planet, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I have a friend
like that who was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> he's an animator for an anime studio here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He did like the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I met him through like
the Pop Team Epic stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like he also just like goes out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's just like, "I'm just
gonna go on a road trip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a month and just like
try and make some money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> along the way and just see what happens." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he comes back with all
these like insane stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of just like him on the
road and being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, I just like walked
into this like random cafe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got a job for like two days
and then got some money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and used that for fuel just
to go to the next place." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like that's so fucking cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I can never fucking do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could not bring myself to just be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know where I'm gonna be tomorrow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what I'm gonna do tomorrow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't do that myself.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't do that either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need like some, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like at least a little bit of a plan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I need some kind of direction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, yeah,
- I like plans. I like plans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like plans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I used to like spreadsheet
all my like spending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in university, like to the penny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I would have like a prediction
of my spending coming up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and what I was allowed to spend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and literally everything in a spreadsheet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then when I started like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my YouTube start giving me
some money in university, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Oh my God, this is amazing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "I don't need
the spreadsheet anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why am I like spending hours a week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> updating this fucking spreadsheet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't fucking matter anyway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm not gonna spend that much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It doesn't fucking matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and like to go
off what we were saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not saying like there's no place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for higher education and
university or everything- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm still glad I went. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, I'm still glad I went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but what I'm saying is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't feel the pressure to need to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because you don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what you want to do with your life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the big thing. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's such bullshit
that by the time you hit 18, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just the expectation
where it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need to know what you're doing now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Your birthday has ticked over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You are now an adult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You need to know everything now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There are 30 year olds
out there, 40 year olds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who don't know what the
fuck they want to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The guy who like founded
McDonald's was like 40 years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like I don't
really feel too bad about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, like I said earlier, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most productive years of your life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> are like 40 years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So as far as I'm concerned, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just fucking up
until you get to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can like actually do shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just fucking up enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> until you found out a way
to not fuck up, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Build the foundation of the character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you want to be, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It all goes back to
the snowboarding, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like just tumble a couple of times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until you learn how to not tumble. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Damn, what a good ending. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow.
- Cue credits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get good, get good in life. </SPEAKER_00>
