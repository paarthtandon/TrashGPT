<SPEAKER_05> you're like you're like a five-year-old </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> milk cookies cause you know hokkaido is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> known for its milk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right hokkaido is known for like a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of things dude milk milk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> food that's the only way to describe it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> everything i had in hokkaido </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tasted so much [ __ ] better it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cream pie yeah kind of oh don't say that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> no it's everywhere oh no it's is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> melted </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> no no no it's all good it's good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah which like when i when i heard you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say like hokkaido has amazing food i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> thinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> man anywhere in japan already has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing food i can't imagine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> somewhere leveling up that somehow like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if it's just like the seafood even just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just for the seafood right because where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i was in hakodate it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a coastal town so they catch all of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the seafood there like fresh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the [ __ ] port and it's oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have a fish market there that we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went to in the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all of the seafood that they sell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there they caught that morning so it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the freshest seafood you can ever get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> legit think of the best seafood you had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just imagine that as just trash </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because that's what garbage is garbage </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> compared to what you can have in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hakodate so i got you another thing as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> well because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god okay so there is this uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's this you got a wish list on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> amazon or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like repair i wanted i wanted to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this for you guys because i feel it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> very uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> indicative of the kind of vibe that we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> go for all right okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's clown juice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> give me some clown juices for the boys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so there's this hamburger joint </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's specific only to hakodate not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even hokkaido it's called lucky pierrot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and they have their own branded energy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drinks right because uh do you guys know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what like guarana is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this the fruit that they use in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like red bull and stuff like that oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah okay they grow guarana and herd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and so i guess they just took that and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's literally just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> clown juice you literally just sent us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> an irl clown emoji yeah i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here's your clown card </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> drink up boys anytime one of us does a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] take we've got to take a drink yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just take a sip of the clown juice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> how is it though uh it tastes like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> energy drink honestly for me it kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tastes like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some weird as it's to say it's like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> healthier red bull </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a red bull with a stronger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> aftertaste yeah i don't know it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's definitely got that i think that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely the guarana yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i can't decide if it tastes cheap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or expensive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let me tell you this was 150 yen so yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll tell you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll tell you what it actually tastes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a thai red bull oh really and to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> explain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what thai red balls are like so red bull </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> actually originates from thailand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and and yes i don't know that so redwood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> actually originated from thailand but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the version they have in thailand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is not carbonated it's like it's like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> thick syrup </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and whenever like the only people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drink really drink red bull </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> in thailand it's like truck drivers who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like need to stay up yeah you drink one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's like drinking five the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> equivalent of likes five red bulls you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get anywhere else </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but i think uh i think this has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> probably the same amount of caffeine as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like a regular red bull but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think we're going to be loaded on this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> podcast but uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so but but they also have like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> non-carbonated stuff as well so they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have like guarana juice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just this basically it's as you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> said it's like a non-carbonated red ball </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> essentially and it had that it actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tastes really [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i think it works better than a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coffee in my opinion even though it has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just as much caffeine as a coffee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so suffice it to say that for the rest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of this episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we all just [ __ ] had a coffee you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna you're gonna see when when the uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when when this energy drink hits yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because uh we're gonna we're gonna be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll be able to see the heart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> palpitations he's like a beer to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> downer you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> no we're definitely gonna like we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna kill ourselves this episode yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah um i just wanted to get you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> guys some gifts yeah thank you very much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now i feel super bad that we didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get anything no it's okay although we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't really get any souvenirs either </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> for ourselves that's all right but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hopefully like we'll actually be able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> take like a proper boys trip up yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i know like you guys have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> saying how much you want to go up to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> north right yeah i really do i really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> really really want to go in the winter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because it seems like really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of things happening in the winter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah i want to i want to hit up the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> onsen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the winter that's going to be so nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah just trying to get naked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i just want to get naked we haven't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> talked about onsens on this podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> publicly haven't seen your guys dicks so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> much now that i don't even question it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to the onsen with you it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're mad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first time we used to like first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> time went to the onsen together i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh we got to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but now it's just like whatever we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> getting naked with the boys another day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with the boys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like i feel like a lot of people are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> afraid to go to onsens for the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because because of that barrier right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you just have to be naked in front </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the boys i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in a lot of countries it's not very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> normal is it yeah some people have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah you want to come to the onsen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know they that immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just like no i don't want to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and they're like oh because i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> want to get naked and i'm like it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like it wasn't even like a decision it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like in the head it was like of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> course it's no i'm not getting naked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but it's like but everyone around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you is naked yeah yeah it's like you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> not going to be the only one that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> naked it's like most european countries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> naked yeah right but that's surprising </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> though isn't it is that like i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> tried to convince so many of my european </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends to go on onsen because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my head it's just like oh bathing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> together is like a very normal thing in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> europe in a lot of european countries </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right so i'm like oh well if it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> normal in their country and their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> culture then it must be easier so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so many times i'm like hey you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to go to the onsen they're just like no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i don't know maybe like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> our generation it's like less of a thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than it was like 20 years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah in the older generation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because i remember trying to convince my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cousin to go to the onsen when he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> visited japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and it was just it was just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> breaking down layers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right so first i'm not just i'm just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like yeah it's kind of it's kind of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> how can i like because he's the biggest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normal you can imagine right so how do i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> explain the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cultural significance of like an onsen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and a hot spring to someone who has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never watched an anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the same cousin that watched the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> live action at that one time yes yes yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like he's like seven eight years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> older than me so he's from like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> older generation as well so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> had to be like okay so it's kind of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a hot tub </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's like a public hot tub yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he was like oh yeah that that sounds fun </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> experience and it's a really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cool experience i mean his voice tone </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> significant culture that pertains like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all of thailand but i feel like with </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> izakaya is just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean should we explain what an izakaya </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just in case people don't know sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for those who are uncultured </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> um basically a japanese pub </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically but like it's like it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like a restaurant and a pub </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 75 percent pub and 25 restaurants </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah let's say yeah but like in a pub in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the uk but it's not depressing yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's depressing and also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> for some reason i always feel pressure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to leave in the uk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah or like just drink like not sit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> down and eat oh yeah i have this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> pressure that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> drink don't you're not here to eat right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because like when you go with your your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends to the pub </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm always that [ __ ] he's like i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> getting a meal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because it's just it's just really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> inconvenient because you're there with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a table full of pints </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah and then there's this guy who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just orders like a three-course meal and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like where are we meant to fit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't give a [ __ ] i got to hold that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would like slowly nudge the 12 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beers out of the way to make room for my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like extravagant curry from weather </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> spoons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the tables like down here you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like bombing out do you do you like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> pubs in the uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i love them in london i thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> london had great pubs i don't know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really don't like pubs pubs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pubs are the one thing about the uk that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i like anytime i go out the uk i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes this is a much better drinking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> establishment than a pub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's just i don't know what it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is about pubs in the uk i just find it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so [ __ ] depressing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because yeah it depends it depends which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one do you go to london has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a ton of like pubs that are like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lively and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really great atmosphere but they're also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> equally as i mean you guys took me to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh it was like a gaming pub right that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> shut down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> oh really yeah that pub was a mess there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't even call it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i wouldn't even call it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like a gaming bar but like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> dirtiest gaming box </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what was it called again meltdown </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meltdown it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a gaming bar with like five pcs one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dirty old wii u no it wasn't even a wii </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> u </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> are we you and like they would be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the same people who would hog the pcs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there was no limit or anything so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just awful it was terrible yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know you compare a gaming bar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> anywhere else and you're like that dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they've got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> games yeah they got real like the way i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> would describe meltdown is it's it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically like a unibar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was but they charged more than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the unibar it was just this it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a run down bar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and like every single bar in london that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is even remotely interesting i feel is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sort of run down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately yeah i can see that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because i don't know the thing about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> pubs that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i hate is that for some reason they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just seem so dark i don't know it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything they're like i think what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pops are you going to man there's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> many in london that are so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anytime i go to like a pub styled bar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anywhere else the first thing i notice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> is man it's so bright in here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is nothing like british pubs this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is nothing like british pubs at all are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you like going to the pubs that are like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> down the alley </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like like the proper like local </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pubs because in the uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's the pubs that anyone goes to and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then there's the pubs that have like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exact same 30 people going right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and those are the depressing as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i don't know most 90 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of weather spoons i'd say fit under that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> category yeah okay most weather spoons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> are weather springs is a brand of pubs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the uk it's just like this ultra </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> treat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> brand and you took me to one i did take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you to one i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason people go there is because of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the very very cheap drinks and cheap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> food that you use what was it like five </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pounds for like a full course meal or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right you basically get like a full </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> course meal with an alcoholic drink for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seven pounds which is like nine dollars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in london in london which is like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> london the drinks alone normally were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like eight dollars which i'm probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people in california are like oh that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like in the uk that's bear in mind where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i grew up yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a drink that's over three pounds which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is like four dollars like whoa yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because of this guy yeah like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you go to a pub in australia like for a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pint it's like nine bucks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean where i the what the weather </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> spoons this is the cheap areas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where i i grew up it was like their main </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> selling point was like two pound pints </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and sometimes some of the special brews </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were like one pound sixty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wow so that's like two dollars something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a pint yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and you have no no wonder that there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like people are there from like 2 p.m </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> until 9 p.m just like dead getting their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> money's worth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because like to me pubs are just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the place where you pre-drink before you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> actually go out to the establishment you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> want to go to right that's that's that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how i see it whereas </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with uh izakayas i can [ __ ] stay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> there from the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> beginning of the night at the end of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> night yeah you don't feel pressured to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> leave and you normally have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're normally just cordoned off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> decently well when you feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just you and your mates yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whereas sometimes the pubs having to see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone around you is a little like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> my god it's busy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the one thing i don't like about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i guess like uk style pubs and there are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of those in japan as well um there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this place called the hub </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which i'm sure you boys are aware of is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh don't go to there by the way because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's like going into a uk pub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but in japan so why the [ __ ] writer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> okay but it's a little bit brighter i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> heard though if you're a foreigner and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you really want to pick up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some people who are really into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> foreigners oh yeah yeah yeah they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> probably there because they know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> foreigners go there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if you have the yellow fever but can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> be bothered to go the traditional route </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go to the hub yeah yeah but shibuya </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll be fine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but like like every time i go into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a hub </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just well first of all it's like 99 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> foreigners it's also very depressing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's also very depressing because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like kind of structured like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm saying right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's structured like a uk pub where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the seats are kind of sporadic and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone is standing around you so you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just feel really claustrophobic yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> don't mind standing and drinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes standing is fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know like i i need a table yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there definitely needs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> needs to be a table there where i can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> leave my drink if i'm just like standing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in the corner which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes on like a friday or saturday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> night in england where some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pubs are crowded and you just have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stand there in the middle of the floor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just with your mates i'm just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is this is not the vibe i want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go my legs hurt i want to sit down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the thing i like about izakaya is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you're always sitting down you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your own </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sanctioned corner where you can just sit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and talk to your mates and it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the perfect kind of catch-up vibe that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look for when i just want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just chill with my mates and just she's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just so cheap like you can go to any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> izakaya here and like the most you'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pay for a beer is like what like 400 yen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe that's like a pretty that's that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an expensive one yeah i'm saying like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the max </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> normally you pay between 200 and 300 yen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> a beer which is like two three dollars i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> went to an izakaya though whereas 50 yen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what's the point 50 pm how do we even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compete because one thing that doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make sense to me right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that sometimes it's cheaper to drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in an izakaya than it is to go to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> family martial </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kombini and buy like a can of beer buy a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can of beer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which like can you imagine if that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the case in the uk like if going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tesco's it's more expensive than going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to your local weather spoons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like nobody would drink at home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah everyone would just be out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> constantly drinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think the uk economy would just stop i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think i think it would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the country would fail oh my god yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like the i think the one thing i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like about izakayas is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again like even people who don't drink </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> can still go to an izakaya and have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> good time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because as as you know we've established </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's mostly like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drink based but the food a lot of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> times is also so freaking good and cheap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you could probably you probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> won't have as much fun yeah if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weren't drinking but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could easily take your friend who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't drink at all and they'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably still have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know a decent time right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because like the food there you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> easily order </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of like snack kind of foods it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's not like you have to order a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah you know what i mean it's all your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> giant [ __ ] pub burger yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i will say that i do feel like the food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is a coin flip sometimes at the izakayas </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you can normally tell which one's gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> have bad food but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes the food is just really bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> are you only saying that because you got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no idea i did get food poisoning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i did get food poisoning very recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but then the more i've been living in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan and the more i've been eating out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at restaurants in japan the more i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realized like my god this food is so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> much better than the izakaya food yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's fine yeah yeah you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normally just sticking to karage and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like the japanese boneless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fried chicken yeah yeah i mean yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> don't get me wrong like the izakaya food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is good but there's definitely like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you want problems </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> there's something like a proper </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> establishment there's sometimes there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> are many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> kind i'm eating it and i'm like god this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> food is depressing it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really like there's one near our where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we're filming this that like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know the one it was the underground </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they had like the driest chicken i'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> ever seen in my life you'd think of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they'd like left this chicken out to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like die in the sahara desert before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> harvested it yeah it was pretty anemic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah everything on it was just kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right i guess you just didn't love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> your job today yeah the food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that that one is definitely like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's not horrible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it's gonna be that that bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when like the menu everything is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 150 yen oh yeah well you get what you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pay for something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right right but like comparing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> izakaya food to some of the like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the pub food that i'm used to i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think pop food's really [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the uk am i really yeah maybe i'm too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> white to make this point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know because if i had a choice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pub food is where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go if i like have no other choice or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever i can't be bothered to i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> promise right hand on heart if i had to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> choose between izakaya food and english </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pub food i'd go with pub food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> no joke no joke i've had food </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> joey's [ __ ] biased no i'm not not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> he's never gonna admit that no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't care about your opinion okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shut up for a second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> okay fine okay like because it's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of the same thing with australian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pop food as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know man i can't comment you ask </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these are wild cause australian because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australian pubs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh is kind of the same as the uk pubs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right where most people just go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to drink usually it's very [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> depressing because it's just a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like middle-aged dudes have been sitting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there since like 2 p.m </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right just like wasting their life away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like a lot of pubs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in australia they have really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> good food but the problem is is that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> only get a set portion of food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like a stupid amount of money right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and so sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a cost thing yeah well yes so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i'm hearing is that i smell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bro joey's broke yeah you will be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> once you go to an australian pub you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> will be it's like 25 bucks for a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> pizza it's like it's just not worth it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the thing is is that with australian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pub food a lot of it's good but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you know even before you go into the pub </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> what food is going to be there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah this is so little variety you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> know same thing could be said with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> izakayas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but i feel that it's always the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] in izakayas i don't know man like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> different izakayas have different things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that they specialize yeah but then i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like pubs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason i love izakaya food is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like designed to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well with the beer or alcohol that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're drinking it just it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the perfect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the synergy you were talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the pizza synergy i was right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about that by the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it just synergizes so well together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> whereas with pub food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it is like the same it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you put this in your stomach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i think yeah sometimes it is but not all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the time like there's been plenty of use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guys we've been to where i'm like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weak like this is mid as you would say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> joey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean i wasn't but even like even like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the mid izakayas are still better than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the best pub food i don't i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know i i just don't like pubs i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry england i don't like pubs you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what though i do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really like irish pubs for their food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i feel that at least with irish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> pubs unlike uk pubs there's a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more variety in the food and there's i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least from my experience i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i took you to shitty pubs though yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i feel less pressure to get out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> an irish pub than i do at uk pub if i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just sitting there drinking well i like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> irish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> dublin or yeah dublin and i went to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something like limerick and stuff like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all around ireland yeah i mean the norm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the uk uh apart from england because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i think a lot of england is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> depressing outside of the big cities </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> no offense um like in the small towns in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like whales and stuff there's some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> really fun pubs because it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 20 yeah but i'm not going to go to wales </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no reason to go to wales jerry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm sorry i'm sorry wales it's true we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have to accept that fact unless you like </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> maybe i don't so it's about it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two hours drive from where i grew up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i asked one of my mates i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hey can we go here and just film a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> of [ __ ] i don't know why i was like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe something fun will happen nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fun happened obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but there was also a climbing place that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we wanted to go to so like we'll just go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there after we're done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you mean a hill no no like a climbing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> gym right oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> huge warehouse pretty cool so if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to go there there's a climbing game </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> of tourists from england </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right who were like old very very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> old like 60s </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just hanging around just checking it out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like a gift shop tiny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's a bunch of stores and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went in there you know asking like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we were in a really uh west part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of wales and they normally could speak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> welsh i was like oh well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe i'll ask around see if anyone can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> speak well yeah no one can speak [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> welsh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really yeah i was surprised because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally in that far west i think that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> county is the one with the highest rate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of welsh literacy right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right so yeah nothing there nothing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there so if you've ever wondered what's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh nothing no that's just a really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> comically large train sign </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's actually how do they fit in is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it like on like size two fonts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like the normal uh so normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in the uk each one has like a the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> standard size of uh font yeah it's quite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they literally just add it on there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> really yeah there's a really funny thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah there was a really funny image of a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guy like standing next to it and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like 10 meters it's really really i i'll </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> have some footage up from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the video that mudan can just show on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> screen right now it's [ __ ] huge and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's sad because none of the trains </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stopped there either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> there's there's a really like train that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> goes direct to london that doesn't stop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through there and i think it's only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> local trains and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean at least you have plenty of time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to read it as you go past i want to hear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how like the train lady pronounces it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like is there like an automated message </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> i i i was lying about talking to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> about this i was like why is there a new </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> thing called the big banana which is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guinness world record for the largest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> banana statue in the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why did they just name a town after that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> one scenario </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh no it's because also like every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> banana in australia grows in banana </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> questions that probably makes more sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you should have led with that before you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> told us that anyways </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i have no idea why it's called banana </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they screw a lot of bananas yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only place they grow bananas oh okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> well that makes a lot of like now that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've explained the context that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a lot more stuff yeah exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so we just have stuff like that but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i wish i [ __ ] lived in a place called </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> cockfield </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that'd be hilarious that'd be the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that would be the best [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> conversation feel like it would grow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tired yeah yeah but it's like where are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you from cockfield and you immediately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get a laugh it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i have already blended in with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> conversation how did you just gotta tell </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> chillest it's the chillest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's always nice all foreigners love it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's so easy you press the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> little button </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes it's all you control yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you don't have to order at the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bar you never have to order them never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never i will say that is a hundred times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> better than the uk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you order all your food and drinks from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a tablet there's no pressure to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> water at the bar and they just bring it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is uh one of my favorite izakayas </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> uh on the west side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of ikebukuro and it's underground and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's like it's exactly like in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> izakaya </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it has like food and everything but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you pour your own drinks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah i think i've been to that one as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> well and there's like a huge like tub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's like a [ __ ] barrel full of </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> like miso soup and it's just all you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drink miso soup as well it's the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] thing ever because it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like because miso soup is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the ultimate hangover drink in my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> opinion yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like another thing i want to talk about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when it comes to japanese drinking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> culture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is nomihoudai oh which is um all you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> drink </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which any time you anytime someone from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> england </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> or like america or someone comes here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> see how many like they they learn about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the all-you-can-drink culture yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> boys i'm i'm moving here i'm coming out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> every night </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every australian i've taken to a normal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> holiday has always either been like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so is there like a drink limit or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh it's only for like 10 minutes all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right like it's like happy hour right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like no you can do it for as long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as you want they're just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how are they how much is like a typical </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> nomihoudai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 1500 for 30 minutes is it no no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's cheaper than that you go either </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> either it's like i've seen like 2 000 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yen for two hours yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think it's it's about so it's about 20 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bucks for two hours of all your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> computers where you go but generally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's around that price around that price </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and compared to like everywhere you see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in england </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and everything that's like a massively </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> good deal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly it's like why would you not like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> even if you can't drink that much right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why would you not take that even if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm at like a brisk pace yeah it's still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a good value for money yeah because even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> say like you know it's like 500 yen for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a beer yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you drink four beers in the two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hours you're still getting your money's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worth yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so it's like every time i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't really feel like drinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's go let me hold it i i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because obviously when you move here you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of like stop wanting all you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> drink because you're like it wears off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah well the first few times i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> visited here i remember thinking like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> treating it like an olympic event i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like right how many can i do in the chat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no because because that's that's what it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would be like if there wasn't all you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can drink in england </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right well it would be yeah that's how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> we think because that's how we're wired </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like yeah you're like 80 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> speed running i was like i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> get the clock ready time time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember i literally had this dilemma </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like i was drinking a beer and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first one i smashed it back no problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was easy second beer i was like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm two seconds off pace </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i remember i i actually remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like i'm one minute off the pace </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> actually i'm so good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like exactly the same you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if how many </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how many beers do i need to drink to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> make this worth in how many can i go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> over yeah you're like calculating this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in your hair to be like okay if i drink </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one beer every five to ten minutes then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i can smash this many beers and i would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> earning back this amount of money you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> know what i mean yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're trying to get like stalks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because because we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember this we i first came here as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a tourist we visited a bar that had 200 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beers yeah i thought okay that's my new </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> baseline yeah for all you can drink </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i need to make sure i get more of my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> money </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i need to make sure it's more better </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> value than 200 yen a beer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so i think we went to one that was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> 2 000 yen for two hours and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay in my head i'm working it out i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay yeah that's ten beers and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i need to get at least ten beers yeah so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like all right i gotta get 11. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just to just to get an under so i feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this was worth coming to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i remember i was in so much [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> pain on like the ninth beer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that i got because we were eating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> as well yeah my stomach was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i think it was like eight beers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in where i was like i don't know if i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> forgot to tell you but you can get other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> drinks too like it's not it doesn't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to be just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i knew that getting all you can drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like spirits was playing with fire oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and i would i would have been like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the floor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so i'm like nah i'll stick with beer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because beer is like the natural piece </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> now i'm gonna take you guys to the 50 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yen beer place because it's not an oil </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you can drink but it's 50 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean it's 50 yen so it might as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be all you can yeah right because i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like that's just the difference in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mindset between anyone from like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> west </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people in japan right because when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anyone in the west comes over and hears </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all you can drink or you can eat it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a it's the same mindset where it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i've got i've got to [ __ ] speed run </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this optimize this what is the optimal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> speed one strats </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all you can drink and japanese people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are just like you know we just drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> however much we feel like it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the pressure of not having to know how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much i'm gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because i think it works on like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the trust system yeah because i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we trust you not to be a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> alcoholic because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why this would never work in any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other country but like japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because i remember i went to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh i went to this uh kind of like no it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wasn't a wine bar was like the place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that they make wine what's that called </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> winery that's that's the place so i went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> to this winery with sydney um just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> outside of tokyo </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and they basically had a cellar of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about like a thousand different wines </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right and basically you could you could </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sample as much as you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> as much as you like for ten bucks ten </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bucks you had a seller of a thousand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's gonna be some willy wonka test </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like if you actually go greedy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're gonna like get killed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's exactly the point that's exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the point i'm trying to make so uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so me and sydney went in being like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> exact same mindset where it's like there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> must be a catch there must be a gadget </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of them is poison so we go down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there and there and they give us like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this little cup right it's like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> super small cup </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh where you can pour like i'd say a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> third of a glass of wine into it okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and these japanese people were just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> pouring like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one little drop like two little drops </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now just like just like letting it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> letting the drop like sit on their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tongue yeah yeah and then we were just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but we can draw we can pour however much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we want rice sorry in sydney </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like because that's that's the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's based on the trust system yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you know if you want to but but if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> want to you can just pour however much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you want for as many wines as you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and no one's going to stop you right so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's something there's something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> similar to that that i saw in uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> oh [ __ ] where was it i think it was in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nagano when i went for a trip it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a sponsored trip and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at the station because nagano is kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> known for its sake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah there was exactly the same thing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like 50 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to like 100 like barrels of all sorts of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different sake and it's like yeah again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it was like one of everything yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like yeah it was like a thousand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yen for like all you can test </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> oh you can test oh you can it's not all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you can drink it's all you can test yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all you can sample and i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> hell yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but but there's nothing stopping you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from sampling as much as you're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like 20 and i was like i'm only a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> fifth of the way through this i'm about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to [ __ ] like imagine if you can ask </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for a free sample but there's no one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stopping you from asking for unlimited </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> free stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you get unlimited free samples that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically the mindset </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so it's so like we're here as a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> westerner thinking we got the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cheat code to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so we can just like it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bottomless fries but if you can go up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and get your own fries right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's like having a buff in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this country it's like being british </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the alcohol it's like oh [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what's like another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> establishment that's like very specific </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to like japanese nightlife because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like to think that like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> karaoke nightlife i mean karaoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> nightlife here has just got it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> done like it's it's it's the perfect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the perfect kind of place for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> karaoke because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i didn't realize until recently but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the karaoke in japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is so much different to the perception </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of karaoke in western countries because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when uh yumi and felix </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we took felix to a karaoke for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> first time he didn't want to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah he was kind of like oh karaoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> cringe that sounds cringe because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think in his mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> his idea of karaoke is an open bar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> karaoke yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> which i think a lot of people think i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think a lot of people think because in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japan i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after the izakaya you know or after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> going to a pub in england </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the the president is after the pub you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically go clubbing there's no other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> place to go but in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> in japan you'll go home and watch yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah exactly right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but in japan you can just go to karaoke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and just continue the sesh there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> also hang out with your mates and sing a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bunch of songs as well it's all you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> drink it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again it's all you can drink everywhere </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you go in japan you can get all you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's [ __ ] great it's all you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> drink and the karaoke establishment is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> open 24 hours yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just like a power move yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> although i swear like whichever brand is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> offering because not all of them do all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can drink and some of them do it for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like way more expensive than others oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i never know which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] one it is so i just walk in and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like please be the cheaper that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah that's the thing though like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go around to each brand of karaoke chain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah and kind of be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay this is the cheapest one for all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can drink this is the most expensive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one for you can drink so you have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of be like okay do i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> take value over price or price over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> value yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right because you know that if you go to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the cheap ones the food is probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> going to be like not that great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like i've never like my entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> life i've never really enjoyed karaoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until i experienced karaoke in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not only it's not only like having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having a private room so to explain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese karaoke you have this private </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you can just sing as many songs as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you like that you choose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um there's no one watching you apart </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from your own mates and you can just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have fun and sing whatever the hell you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> want it's basically just karaoke at home </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right they also have like every single </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like western song so yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so like they have a selection that is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like it that eclipses everywhere else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they have like english songs chinese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> songs korean songs and obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> japanese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anime songs i was about to say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> man singing singing anime songs while </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're playing it as a weeb </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was like i remember my first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> experience was with joey and it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the funnest experiences </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever it's like seeing that list of all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the anime songs it's like opening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pandora's box </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like which one do i sing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like and then the moment he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> selected [ __ ] tell me why by the pen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> pals i was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah okay the original the original </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> berserk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the shittiest guitar riff in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> existence i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah hell yeah like it's already bad in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the original but then the karaoke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> version was like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this is so much worse but it's so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better it lasted at 3am we [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> destroyed that song more than it already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> destroyed itself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like three times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's back open though right from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i understand yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's hard to get in that mood you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know yeah i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i know it's like i don't know like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel now that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we've all kind of been established here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like become a little bit more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> difficult to just be like hey you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to stay up till like 4 00 a.m to go to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> karaoke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe because i get i go to bed at like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 12 now i think i get really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> tired earlier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like my sleep schedule's a lot healthier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> now okay to explain another thing about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese drinking culture is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you have this ticking clock and it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> called the last train and if you missed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the last train </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you're staying out until 5am there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> there's there's no there's basically no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in-between either </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you choose to go home at like what like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 11 12 11 12 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 11 11 30 which to me is like if it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just one hour later or like two hours </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> later it would be perfect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because after about one o'clock i'd be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like okay i've had my fun this is this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has been cool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm gonna catch the last train now but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like having to choose between going out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at uh like 11 30 when you're just about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> getting to that point of drunkness that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you just want to keep your mind going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to staying up till 5 00 5 a.m which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we've done it several times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and every time i just feel more dead </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> inside i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is there is nothing worse i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think the only thing that is worse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going home while you're buzzed at 11 p.m </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> catching that first train at 4 30 just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my god it's like sunny outside and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this businessman next to you and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> clearly a [ __ ] mess you just turn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into [ __ ] vampires </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i [ __ ] fell asleep one time and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> missed my stop by like an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hour i woke up at like 6 a.m like in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so [ __ ] northern like the end of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> line right yeah yeah i was like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> hour from like i think i was like an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hour and a half from tokyo yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's how far i'd gone and i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get back and i was so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] done yeah i was it was like 6 30 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a.m when i realized and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no so i wanted to sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean that's the tough thing man i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing like back when i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like still single </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like kind of going out and doing a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lot more of like the 4am 5am stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it would be a little bit easier because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you know say like a couple of my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would be like it'd be like you know one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or two a.m </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like uh maybe we shouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> continue anymore it was really easy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you could just go to a manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cafe and just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> book a [ __ ] room for like two three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hours yeah just [ __ ] sleep in there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> until the first train </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and that [ __ ] but we haven't done that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we should do that more often </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> instead of just being like let's let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> uh let's call up a taxi and spend 100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> bucks to get home </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've always known that you can do the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> manga cafes i just don't want to have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that conversation at 3am smashed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some japanese do drum like uh manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah hi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> every single time it's been like i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just wait till 5am i'll just yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> we should just do that from now on yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if we're having like a boys now we just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like i don't want something because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't want to spend a hundred bucks to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] go coffee you know we're all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going back the same way it's time you </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> yo okay you know what else i like in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan it just goes along with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> nightlife yeah right it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the uconn drinks uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> explain that you can't drink because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that so i should have i should have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bought one in preparation if yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we can talk about this but there's these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like tiny little things like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 200 milliliter cans yeah it's like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> medicine bottle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah it tastes like bubble gum and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's apparently like ginger like it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't taste like bubble gum i think it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tastes like awesome i think it tastes i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> think it tastes great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> turmeric turmeric it looks like ginger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thank you melon but uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that tastes like i like do you like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i like i like the taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> felix liked the taste yeah but felix is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it reminds me of calpol that's that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why i like the taste so essentially what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this drink is advertised as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is uh prevents hangovers yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone in the western world is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't seem right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm pretty sure if it worked we would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that was my thought as well like how if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it really works </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why has england's not used this before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't you think the entire budget of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nhs would be spent on buying this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then all of the medical problems would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> be sold like i'm pretty sure we would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> have it right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i thought and then one day on a whim i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was like all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fine i'll try it yeah and then it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like having a shield </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on your liver like none of the drinks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got me drunk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and it was like that for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first few times until i really drank way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too much and then it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not drunk not drunk not drunk absolutely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> unable to sleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like not it's so weird it was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the 2020 economy it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a corona virus tank and then you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] drunk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in like in like an instant because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> never tried it until i tried it with you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because every time i saw it i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no that maybe that will work for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one drink yeah i don't go to a musical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and have one drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> so i'm like no this won't work for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but then yeah i had it and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it tastes like us i'm like great this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> already a good start yeah and then yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i think i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> four or five drinks you don't feel it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i'm just like oh my god it's weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the immunity </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so like it's it's advertises that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't have a hangover but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> really i think you it's it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> formatted alchemist it's like law of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> equivalent exchange right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you drink it and you okay your [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> mother so you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you drink it and you get less drunk when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're drinking it so you have to drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more to get drunk but then the day after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like if you did completely destroy your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> body i feel like it doesn't help in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hangover </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you go too hard it doesn't help but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know those times where maybe you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> quite a bit you're quite tipsy you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not like absolutely shit-faced yeah it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> completely stops any hangovers yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please stop any hangover but for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it stops that tipsy feeling as well yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my in my mind when it comes to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whether it gets rid of the hangover the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> next morning i feel like a lot of it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just placebo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's just like if i drink this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it'll probably stop it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i definitely definitely feel an effect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because the hangovers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the worst hangovers i've had in japan is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i haven't drank that right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so now i pretty much like you'll never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> see me go like drinking without drinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it now yeah which i don't know if it's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> good thing or not like is my body gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> get dependent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> on it to drink because like anything i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always drink it when i know i have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something to do the next day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not bad for you by the way it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's literally just like two americans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if anything is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very very healthy it's just a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] minerals and [ __ ] i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like like look at me a monkey break like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i know what's in it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'll question this [ __ ] just look it up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you'll find it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah from what i understand it's it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very healthy it's like a health drink </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> someone's going to come and be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's actually it destroys your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> liver it's like as if the alcohol </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't already destroy them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> hidden health benefits hidden health </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> benefits of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god what do you how do you boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> feel about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clubbing and because i've not been to a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> club in japan before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i've been to a few but i've never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoyed clubbing even even back in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> australia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just never really a thing yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> don't i like bars but i don't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i really like bars but i don't like club </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay here's here's my theory i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> clubbing is this place that everyone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> convinced themselves they enjoy when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they really don't enjoy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's clubbing is one massive lie i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know anyone who actually enjoys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> clubbing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the only time you enjoy clubbing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is if you're massively plastic if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually enjoy clubbing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're someone i don't want to talk to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> people the people i know who enjoy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> clubbing are not me the ones who i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't like hanging out with yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> know i'm not going to like the epitome </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they always talk like it's like clubbing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like clubbing is great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're like young i guess but then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you you reach a certain point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a few years past and you realize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> man i'd never really enjoy clubbing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was just lying to myself all i do when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i go to a club </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is go in see the dance floor order a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drink go go dancing for like five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes realize i'm still too sober go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> order another drink </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then that cycle repeats repeat until </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you're [ __ ] drunk enough to not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember the night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and if you do remember the night it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] night yeah right and it hurts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like you've got to pay entry fee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then you've got to pay like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> double the price for a drink so if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not drunk enough it's like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not only am i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> my am i having a [ __ ] time my wallet is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> taking a financial beating </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> clubs are fast man they're a lie yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll tell you the only times clubbing is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fun but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> can i tell the story about the last time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we went club sure sure go ahead </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i feel like the only time clubbing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is actually fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is when the night isn't planned when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you don't plan to go to a club i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the spontaneous clubbing nights are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the best because you're already really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drunk and in the mood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when when you just suddenly decide to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to a club so the last time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've actually went clubbing was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over a year ago yeah with uh and it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with connor and two of my mates right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was just a spontaneous kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clubbing night where we didn't even plan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go clubbing we just wanted to go hit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up some bars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we got massively i think we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> were just sitting at your house and we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were just gonna do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah i think someone brought it up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and we were like clubbing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i i think the i think we were we were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like we were sitting in the house and we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were just gonna have like a chilled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> night right we were telling stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about clubbing we were telling stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about clubbing and i think eventually we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were like should we just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> go clubbing yeah because i remember we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hit up a bar beforehand and we were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty we were pretty uh we were pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> merry at that point we weren't super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drunk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we got to the bar i think it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like absolute like absolutely vodka </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in brighton or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we just ordered like three of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 14 shot trays oh my god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we got drunk very very fast but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the person who got drunk the most was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i think i had like one of the whole like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> 14 shots to myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm like bear in mind i think i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said at the time i just like broke up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with my ex and i was like i just want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go out i just want to come here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i just want to do something i want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get out of here it happens yeah i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like i almost want to party and then i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> went i went waiting so what was the last </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> memory you had that night i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> waiting in line for the club </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> alcohol abuse is bad by the way yeah we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't condone this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a story not condoning we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> laughing about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've rarely rarely do i get that drunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't remember exactly what happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is which i when i speak to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> americans like that sounds scary i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean i'm around my mates you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they'll take care of me so after the bar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we clearly realized how drunk connor was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but we still it was still like pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> early in the night it was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like 10 o'clock 10 30. the club </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had just opened but that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that's kind of the timing we're talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about and we're kind of we're all like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> before the alcohol gets connor anymore </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we gotta [ __ ] get in this club as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> soon as possible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so we line up just as the club was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> opening never mind it's like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wednesday or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah no one was clubbing no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like us we were worried about how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> connor was gonna get in because he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> clearly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over the [ __ ] limit and if you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> uk clubs if you look like you're too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drunk i'll be fine they're just not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to let you win bounces </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bouncers in the uk are like the but the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> school bully like yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're like they will take advantage of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> any power they have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> so we're [ __ ] worried so somehow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> connor we managed to get connor in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this club okay this is the best heist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> movie yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we managed to get connor and we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh that's this is it we've done it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we've been with you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we've done mission impossible yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so then we go over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the bar as you do in the clubbing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience the first thing you go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is the bar of course and then we go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> order our drinks and so i'm here with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two of my mates </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we we each order a drink and then we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and connor's just not there we're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wait if you're not with connor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're not with connor and i'm not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with connor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then where the [ __ ] connor and then we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> turn around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and look at this like look at this empty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dance floor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and connor is just standing there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at a 90 degree angle he's like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we're like oh [ __ ] we better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get him off the dance floor and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like as we're walking over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he starts [ __ ] fortnite dancing by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> himself on the dance floor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know what you got to do you got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> to do it and so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the bouncer sees this and obviously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> connor's like way over the limit so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he gets kicked out and so we we also we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> also have to follow him out the club so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do we attempt another club it's only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like 10 30. let's try and attempt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> another club </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking we're not gonna get in somehow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> connor by pure instinct </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's like he's like he can't even walk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to this next club but as soon as he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> standing in line he's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes gentlemen yeah i don't know i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> know why when i'm drunk for some reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i can just like for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 30 seconds i could be like yes of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes i don't know why like it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> superpower </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like when you're when he's in front </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of the bouncer he just turns into like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> proper sea dog va yeah the monkey brain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> unlocks into human brain so then we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> somehow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we somehow get him to get him into the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> second club okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the same [ __ ] thing happens again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're going to the bar and then we take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> our eyes off corner for one second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> order our drink i look around look to my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look to my left </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> look to my right if you're not with god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we all know we've got and then we turn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around and once again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> connor on an empty dance floor is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> fortnite dancing by himself is that just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like an instinct for you to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like so i think it must be i like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dancing i don't know why fortnite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dancing must be my go-to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know and so we get kicked out of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that club and that was the end of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> night oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good night it's good night good night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah he he woke up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't get that drunk yeah he uh he we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got him back home </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> uh i took him on the bed and he just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> started snuggling inside the saggy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pillow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah that's what he woke up all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> instincts are getting unlocked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i woke up and i was like where is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my phone and wallet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> where is it and then it was just under </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the bed but i was like that's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> first five minute panic of my i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where is it oh my god so you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> remember any of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember some of it but not much yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean that was probably the most drunk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've gotten in a very long time i rarely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever get that drunk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but you know sometimes you [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and do a lot of vodka and uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what happens man because like you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've been clubbing in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah yeah what's that like how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> does it compare to the rest of the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like at least compared to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uk right in the uk i feel like everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in the club is very drunk and in japan i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt like everyone was in the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> situation of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i need to be drunker which makes a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really shitty club environment because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's kind of sober and it's weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah no almost like step out of line </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's weird like no one's doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> except like for somehow everyone is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really well behaved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and somehow the moment you step into the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> toilet it was like a war zone in that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> toilet i don't know what happened </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was a dude who was like pissing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he was not even aiming in the urinal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he was aiming at the wall next to it and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was spraying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and i i remember walked in and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not getting blamed for this i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walking yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> yeah but yeah there it was so filthy but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the rest of the club was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fine it was whatever it was just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> depressing situation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i'd rather have been smashed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fortnite dancing alone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> any day of the week yeah yeah that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's kind of a similar experience i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had i went to one club in japan and that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was enough for me to be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean i never really enjoyed clubs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i was like you know what i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> living here i might as well give it a go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i just wasn't it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i felt like everyone was doing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because they've seen it in the movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> there i don't know why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's like this is cool right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right now right like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we've seen this in the movies right this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is exactly how we're supposed to behave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right because i i think the like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most different clubbing experience i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had is probably in thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they have like i i don't like i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their club and culture even less </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because they don't even have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dance floor so some clubs in thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um it's you go in and there's no dance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> floor but everyone has their own tables </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the music is just as loud as any </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> other club </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so try and see so you're sitting in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> loud restaurant this is a loud bar right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone has these private tables so you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't even like it's not a social </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> environment where you can go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meet other people or even like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interact with other people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you're with your mates but it's so loud </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can't communicate with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> roommates </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so all you're doing is sitting in this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> loud [ __ ] room i must sound like such </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an old guy now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the music was too loud this was awful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> too fair when the music is too loud it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like my biggest pet peeve yeah like i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've been in some clubs in australia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where the base is so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] bass boosted that you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually hear feel your chest going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> dude it's like this while you're sitting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there i was like hey how are you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my voice is so bassy as well that in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> clubs like i could just cannot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> communicate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it just gets drowned i remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like university if i ever tried to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on someone they'd just be like what are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> do you have that thing where you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to say something to your mate but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so loud </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you sue or your mate's trying to say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something to you and it just sounds like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like uh sorry can you say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that again you do you do it like three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> times as the magic number </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the third time you're like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd be like yeah i don't know i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> know whatever they say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just yeah that's just the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> clubbing experience yeah i guess i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we personally don't recommend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> clubs in japan but i mean i mean okay if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's weird if that's your stick that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we don't we've i think we've made it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> clear that we don't really like clubbing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> anyway so we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not going to enjoy like japan the reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i like izakaya </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is that it's the perfect social </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> environment because i like talking to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> people i like house parties i like house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> parties </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like i've always in university if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a choice between a clubbing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going clubbing going to a house party </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 100 of the time i'm choosing the house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i like talking to people and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like the izakaya vibe is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that perfect vibe that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yes just like you allows you to talk to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> your mates there's also that element of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a house party it's like are they gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] up their own house if someone i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to be there to watch this it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the craziest house party </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys have been to okay i've got like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've got like two and they were both in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> university because of course they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of course they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you have one i mean i can only really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think of like if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i have one if you want me to go first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a lot of like poop stories but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah this is where the poop stories are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> all of my poop stories come from house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> parties what who's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what like uh okay so in australia oh my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> god what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> another thing about this was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> disgusting but oh no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but uh do you know what a shoei is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why you do the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the beer out of the shoe yeah so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this thing that's very typical in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> australia because there's nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why is this typical an australian </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> typical house party yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but essentially what it is is you it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like shotgunning in america </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shotgunning is like you know if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone's holding a can of beer they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh shotgun it so you poke a hole on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the side and then you kind of drink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the whole thing like this chewy is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but way grosser you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you say hey do a shoei and then you go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> around the tradition is you go around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and find whoever has the dirtiest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] shoe oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's not just any shoe it's whoever has </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the dirty shirt it's either you do your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> own shoe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or you pick whoever is dirty it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> already starting horribly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you grab their shoe you pour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the can of beer into their shoe and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you drink the beer from their shoe and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> disgusting and i mean it's not that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exciting of a story but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my friend did a shoei once and he got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> his friend's uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shoe and he didn't realize until after </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he finished the shoei that he had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> stepped on his dog </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] so he had like a firm grasp he had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a firm grasp of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and he finished it and he's like he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> flipped it over he just saw like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just smeared on them and like normal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> people will be like oh what the [ __ ] but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because he was already so ham and he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everyone was like yeah this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] nasty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's the only thing really and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then other than that it's just like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> vomit stories you know the usual thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here at house parties yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean yeah that was probably the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> grossest but also the most hilarious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my god we're at uconn i mean i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> been to like a few crazy house parties </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> uh i think most of the crazy house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parties i've been to has been in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brighton </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so that's like my hometown um there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> are some parties that are just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of like you know that scene from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> american pie where you see that scene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like there's no way that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that exists in real life there's no way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this crazy shit's happening yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah i've been to a few parties </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was actually that crazy so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember one time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where there was this there was this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> party who we'd heard from a friend who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> heard from another friend who heard from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> another friend no that kind of that kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of thing that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> been into a horse that there was a party </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happening in the middle of this field </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just like there's no [ __ ] way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is true so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we had to drive into the middle of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] nowhere and i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this is a scam we're gonna we're gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drive there and there's just gonna be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just gonna be like a drug dealer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then or something yeah this is gonna be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we're gonna we're gonna get [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> murdered yeah and so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we drive to the middle of this field and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this keep in mind this is all pitch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> black because it's like the middle of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the country </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where we're driving to so we can see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] and then we go there and it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> basically like a festival </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somehow they had managed to because this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guy who had owned the farm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right had just had just told a few of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his mates that he was going to have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> party </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and then mate started telling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mates and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's always the worst yeah i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know how it spreads so wide </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right jesus but i feel like it's because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no one else is having a party that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> weekend and people were just egging </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like people were just i really wanted to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go somewhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i needed a party and yeah somehow there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was a [ __ ] festival </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then things started getting weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they started saying things on fire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so so they went into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his house right and then they took out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this sofa </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and somebody thought it would be a fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> idea to just start burning stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it started why is always one person i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there's always one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pirate one [ __ ] pyromaniac right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so first it starts with a chair so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they get they get a chair out right i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like okay let's set this on fire and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like [ __ ] caveman mode activates </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like whenever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever you start to fire for some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reason like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you see fire and then you're like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> fire and then like you start [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dancing around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh fire i don't know why whenever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a fire in there like a house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> party and there's alcohol involved </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you just forget the lizard brain just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> takes over and you just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you just like circling just watch it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and then so they burn they burn the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chair down and they were like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> what can we do next what can we do next </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> next let's get a table </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so so out of nowhere just take this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy's whole [ __ ] ikea collection </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like jesus so then they take a table </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they set that on fire then as that's on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fire a [ __ ] sofa appears out of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nowhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they [ __ ] just chuck the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> sofa in and then we were just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the back of my mind i'm thinking man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the host must feel so [ __ ] [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know where he's probably passing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out his mind oh my furniture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then as the sofa is on fire we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually see the host </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just walk out and he just looks at this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so his sofa and like his [ __ ] ikea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> furniture collection that's on fire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just goes yeah what if right what if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all along you planned this out right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because in the uk if you want to get rid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of stuff like that you've got to pay a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so maybe this was all a ploy just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so he could get new sofas and shares and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> not pay to remove his old ones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah there's always also that one guy in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any kind of situation like that where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something's put on fire where they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like holding a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> alcoholic beverage and they're like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> wonder what happens if i pour it off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this will probably put it out right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it just makes the flame bigger it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i was expecting that okay every time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every [ __ ] time animals yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cavemen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a so you know how i said i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lived in like a student village yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it was basically a whole area that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> was just houses and they had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> also two really big uh like apartment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> blocks and they were disgusting they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were like the cheapest apartment blocks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you could imagine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and uh one time people this doesn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> exist anymore this place they tore it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> uh so yeah swansea student village r.i.p </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> a party at one of the apartment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buildings they didn't say which floor or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything so i thought that was kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then we turn up and like half </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of this apartment building there's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bin bags </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on all the windows right and stuff and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then you start going into this building </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's like been turned into like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> set of the raid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like there's just [ __ ] everywhere like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's mattresses on the floor and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all over the place and some of the rooms </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are open and have like nothing left in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> them and i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what the [ __ ] meanwhile everyone is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> drunk as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like people doing drugs in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> certain places yeah people in the </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> these parties like this building is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally like falling apart and one </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> pizza yeah any beans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just weird and it was like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> further up you went the like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more mess it was and i remember going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> one floor and there was just like </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> and i'm like what the [ __ ] is going on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was just weird and then i just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't enjoy it because i'm like what is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this wait wait so what was the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like an orgy floor or like what i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't how did you get invited to this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> party it was one of those things where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone in like just everyone knew it </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_06> steps towards hell it's literally the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> raid it's like the opposite right it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like the further up you go the closer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you get to hell </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because i mean you have no way of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> knowing in the uk what the party's going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> get there if your friend's like dead set </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> on going you're like all right fine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i've been to as many like dad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> parties where you go to and it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this isn't a party this is a house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gathering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah with with like prettied up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we're freaking out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right you never know a party could mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a come dine with me four people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> making dinner for each other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or it could be you know a [ __ ] orgy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> going on upstairs yeah you don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until you get there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jesus christ no one knows my parents are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably terrified they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what was conor doing in university i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not doing anything mother </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was just you happen to go to places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they [ __ ] up yeah it's funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because i did i had less crazy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> parties in university but that might </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just be because of the university i went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to which was like yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> university of bristol and because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a city campus it's like university </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> britain was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bristol was like in the middle of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> city there was like less going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was all like we're integrated with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the normal people yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not more working people so you can get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> away with less [ __ ] than if it was on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like a couch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah mine was kind of the same because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> sydney uni was in like the smack bang </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> middle of like the city center in sydney </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean there was always weird [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> were happening in like the smaller </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> campuses but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing like that there was just so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> run down places so it was like sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i think like locals would like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see a party and then just like go in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i think that happened a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that makes sense that's why i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never throw a house party that just let </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anyone in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no i don't know bro talk about the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> trust system bro you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just that's like the other end of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it like a stupid trust like i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if you were having a party and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> thought like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you told your close mates especially in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> my school because this was like before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i went to university but like in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like in like college </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you if there was a party everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone in [ __ ] brighton would not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know about yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know word would get out and i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not throw a party especially on a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like new year's eve where everyone's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> searching for right right yeah people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just rock up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just yeah i mean that's kind of why i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just kind of don't go to like open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> invite house parties anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because after seeing that i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just too much that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i i'm not i'm not signing up for that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> don't need that in mind yeah it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if i wanted to go to a house party and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like four fifths of the people there are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people i don't know i rather just go to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a club yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's basically it becomes the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> thing right yeah like clubs are pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> bad but at least there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not people doing like [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on the dance floor probably in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> toilet that's them i don't care </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> even fortnite dance yeah kind of a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fortnite dance without people judging me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and me in the orgy room fortnite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh the mattress is a dance floor dance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god oh my god but uh have you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever been to the uh i know it's a proper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like tourist trap or whatever it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> considered by the the golden guy in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> shinjuku </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah i've been i've been a fan would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you like it no no not your thing not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really can i explain what golden guy is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so golden guy is like this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what is like 40 by 40 meters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> area if you will and it's just like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> series of alleyways extremely compact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not even a block </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like it's within the block isn't it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's tiny and these bars all seat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> max three to four people sometimes two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah um depending on where you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh it's really expensive you pay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like sometimes like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 bucks just to sit down and then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only pay like 10 bucks for a drink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and yeah it's a tourist trap because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of the time it's tourists and also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a very sketchy area yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you are a foreigner there will be a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> guy who is very much watching you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah the moment they see your foreign </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll come up to you it's really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] frustrating </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i went in there once uh just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because i wanted to take my friend who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> had never yeah so i was like okay i'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> experience it and yeah i was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man this is just like a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> cramped super expensive drinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> experience that you can get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anywhere else it's like if you see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pictures of it which will probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be on screen now it's it's kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cyberpunk house cloud like i love going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to golden gate just to take photos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's it's like that cyberpunk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> aesthetic where you just got these all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of these buildings and a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these bars just like cramped together </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you don't even know how anyone could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> live in there let alone operate a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> business in here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i can't imagine any of these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bars getting maybe more than like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 10 people across like a night right uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it depends there's one or two of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bars that are decently big but most of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them are yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean there's like a few big ones like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of golden gate like right before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you enter it like near the entrance but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when once you actually go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> into golden gai it's like how do any of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> these places stay open </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's you i think you go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> golden gai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to meet other people right you don't go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there with your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> well you can go there with your members </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can also meet other people anywhere </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's this kind of vibe to it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like because it's so small </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right like you immediately have to talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to anyone who's next to you yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't really have a choice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in the rest of tokyo you kind of go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out your way and be like hi you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> know about my cult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right like you got like really you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> got to pray yeah yeah you've got to seem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a little weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right because yeah but in this bar you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> know you sit down you're immediately </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> next to someone and you start trying to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> communicate and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah the one time i went was because um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i was staying right next to it funny </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> enough </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i think it was one night where uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's my second to last night in japan my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> first time visiting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think joey joey like gone and allen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't want to hang out and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well i want to do something so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i googled i'm like where can i go and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then this was the only place that came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fine i've never heard of it before i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't know it was a tourist trap right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i just went there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh yeah it was really fun i mean met </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a ton of people and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eventually made friends with these like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese people who took me to someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the japanese only bars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and that was really fun because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then they were all talking to me asking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> what my favorite anime was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> knowing the japanese titles came in very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> handy that day oh yeah of course </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's just a lot of fun i mean when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it works and you go out and you meet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people and they're actually cool and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's fun it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the best thing ever i feel like you got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a quite a lucky experience though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in golden gai because i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so yeah i've heard a lot of like horror </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> stories about goals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i think a lot you could easily go there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and just have not mean anything for the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worst time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and yet spend a lot of money because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i've been to like quite a few </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like smaller bars and establishments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that are outside like just outside of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guy this is really [ __ ] cool uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gaming bar that chris broad took me to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like literally across the road from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> golden guy yeah one up or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> zero i think he's called one up yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've been there yeah yeah yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's tiny like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's just one bar can only maybe seat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like you know six people yeah but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's like a proper game but we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> not talking about the one thing you guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> looking to in the uk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right it's like a legit like gaming bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that one was really [ __ ] cool and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> way way cheaper than golden guy but the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> problem is that those kinds of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> places don't come up in google searches </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right it's almost always like where do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you drink and change </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> golden guy always comes yeah i noticed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like a lot of bars in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] tiny and you go in there and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like i really like the vibe because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a really intimate vibe because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it can only fit like five to six people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's only like one bar and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see at the counter um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i do like that vibe and i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how they stay in business because there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are so many in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're so hidden away yeah there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so many like like the cigar bar we went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> ikebukuro right now it was like how the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] would anyone be like yes let me go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into this tiny building go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all the way up to the sixth floor and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there it is right there it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> how would you how would you know that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's yeah yeah right it's it's like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just someone's apartment before we know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it probably is something that they just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remodeled that's kind of like the size </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we're talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah uh like like an apartment in tokyo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just just yeah like a one-room apartment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah well you jumped to that bar that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was like it was like an apartment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> someone's apartment in an apartment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> building that had been converted into a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> penguin oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and i was like what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this and yeah they said food and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> everything it was [ __ ] weird so that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sydney actually discovered that because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she read a manga that i was based on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a manga that had that bar in it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she googled and that bar actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> existed so it's this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's this ping pong bar that has like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this massive ping pong table in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> middle it's like going into someone's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> living room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to get there like we had to go down the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dodgiest alleyway right it was literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hand written sign that says ping pong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bar go down this alleyway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and so we go down this alleyway it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a it's like some [ __ ] from pt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right like there could be someone doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heroin around the corner you had no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] clue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh so we go in there and then we had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go up these stairs and it was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> stone stairs that someone's probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> pissed on you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so we go up and then it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's apartment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just literally someone's apartment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you but then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they open the door and it's like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proper they've probably remodeled it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> into a bar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm thinking man how would anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] discover this because this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hidden away down two [ __ ] dodgy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> alleys that i would not go down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's what i'm saying it's like there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are so many where i'm just like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wouldn't if you didn't have a curious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you weren't afraid that you might </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> possibly get stabbed down this alleyway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are so many places where it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like you'd never be able to see it i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's why i think shinjuku is good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if you're a foreigner because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think a lot of people in shinjuku are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like wanting to meet foreigners and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff like that or shibuya </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so if you stay to those two places yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they're super touristy and everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> knows about them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i think a lot of places outside of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you probably won't find people who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are super eager to talk to foreigners </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe maybe maybe yeah but that's as far </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as you'll probably go right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean in shinjuku you'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely find people who want to speak </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to you if you're a foreigner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like sometimes you go to a bar and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like the people serving you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to have to speak to you as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's fun yeah i like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one place we went to that started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing all of our youtube videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so there was this bar that we went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right there was this bar that we went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it like a really small intimate bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and they've i can't remember who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brought up the conversation but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they found out that sydney was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> youtuber because sydney was there as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she makes the stupid mistake of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> telling her her youtube channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so this bar has like four like has like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three tvs in it right and so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as soon as the bard lady hears her </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtube channel she just like chromecast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sydney's [ __ ] cities videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sydney's video all over the bar where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like other people are also drinking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we're just there watching silly's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtube channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she's she's just like dying inside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a [ __ ] nightmare isn't it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the one thing you shouldn't do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if you have a youtuber friend is play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their videos in front of them oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly what is it about that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never understood just hearing your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> own voice or you being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not like being silly right yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like you're okay with you it's such </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a weird dilemma because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my cousin asked me that same question </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where she's like okay so you're all fine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with me watching your videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as long as you're not there but the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> moment you're there you don't want me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching the video like how does that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> make sense i'm just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know i just don't like it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like i hate it when i have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> re-watch my video to like </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> example if i'm the only one in the room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but if someone's standing behind me like </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> tangent that [ __ ] far away from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever it is that we're talking about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but one place i like to go to a lot is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> baggis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah i like baggers too have you been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in baggage i have not been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay because i was saying before that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> was like i don't i didn't remember it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> was you or connor who hasn't been to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> baggage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've been back but yeah so baggage to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is uh it's like a darts pull </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ping pong there's more other stuff as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well it depends on like something it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mango cafe as well so basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where i did the mango cafe video that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a baggis so they have a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different baggages sometimes they focus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the manga cafe side of things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes they focus on the pool and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> darts bar side of things but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> basically it's this like 24 7 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> establishment that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> where you can just go and like get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> drinks and just hang out and you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> play pool and stuff like that there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> town in shinjuku in shibuya yeah yeah a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot but uh i'm surprised you haven't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> been i don't know i don't think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's yeah i don't know i just haven't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> been yeah it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's one of those places because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you want to spend at least two to three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hours there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't you don't really want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do it before your meal you don't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to do it after your meal because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like best drinking hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so it's normally like you know it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gets to 1am you're like what do you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to do i don't want to keep drinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah exactly it's fine i mean it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of pricey though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is a little if you're there for like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three hours that [ __ ] adds up fast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because they charge you per </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> half an hour half an hour and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you're buying drinks on top which the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drinks are kind of a little pricey i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> mean you can get all you can drink </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> though of course can you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't even know that yeah you can do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all you can drink in a bag yeah again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to be prepared to stay for like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> at least two hours right yeah because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know they do a package that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the till the sun like comes up yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one to six a.m yeah and it's quite cheap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously you're committing yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like i'm going to stay up till 6 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a.m to play pool there's only so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pool you can play before you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this just isn't fun anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we both we both aren't good at pool and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've been doing it for 30 minutes and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm starting to think i don't like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i i feel like i get better when i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drinking apple yeah i don't know that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the alcohol making you think you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no no it's not that you're getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> better your opponent which was just as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> drunk as you was getting worse </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so for some i think i just doubt myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> too much where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when when i'm like playing pool sober </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i think when i'm like about two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pints in i just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start hitting shots i'm like for some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> reason it just goes in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then i have four drinks and then i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> start getting worse again i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like i feel like there's a sweet spot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> where the where i'm like slightly tipsy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm like a [ __ ] god at pool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like that with bowling i like their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> darts because it's not a dart board it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an arcade machine with a dart board </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like yes it's like an electric </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> some of them are so [ __ ] overkill and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what they are like there was one more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you could play a whole rpg </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in dark yeah that's right i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> remember i was like what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like your dart would do x </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount of damage yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's so hard with a straight face </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like if you're on a date or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like hey do you want to you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to play the rpg dog </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that sounds amazing that's pretty great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the first time but then some of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> levels were so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] you had to get like you needed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like a [ __ ] yeah you had to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like triple 20s like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> every single one i mean this is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> medusa should die way easier than this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> come on yeah but like it's it's those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> little touches right that i think add to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the whole like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> bags it is a lot more fun that you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> have to count in the dark because the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> machine just does it for you exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly it does make it a lot longer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've been to like a lot of old-fashioned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> pubs in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> australia where like yeah there is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a dark but you get the real darts into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> those pops </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they have these like [ __ ] but it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> also like plastic dots yeah but it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also like just as dangerous as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i love it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> joey no i'm good man it's all for that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i mean you meet these people in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uk that are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> four pints in and getting they get like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the peak performance out of four pints </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's insane i'm like that with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bowling i [ __ ] suck at bowling while </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm sober but i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> quickly discovered the other day that if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i drink like two or three pints </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before bowling i can do like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> turkey like no tomorrow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you just don't think you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like throw balls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know why but i think bowling is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like the most depressing activity out of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all of the activities </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really i think so i feel like bowling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with alcohol </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is fun it's fine but bowling without </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> alcohol is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> boring i think i feel like i like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> bowling because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't didn't really play it growing up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like i know like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's you're either the kid who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] used to bowl all the freaking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> time for fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> or you were that one kid who would only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ever bowl like balls for fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of people do in the uk apparently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> do they yeah why do you think bowling's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> depressing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know there's an air to it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they're always it just doesn't hit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so i went okay this isn't an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exclusive incident a lot of the places </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like this but i'm just giving this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for an example </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i went to a place in california right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very nice area of california </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and somehow in california this place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that was very like seemed very normal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just this one place and somehow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bowling place was the only place that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gave me mega redneck vibes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i went in there and it was very much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like like that but it seemed like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was just a bunch of people who you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know like i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> have you been bowling in japan though uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no i haven't well then maybe it might </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> change right now unless there's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> screens and shit's [ __ ] like flat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you got to stir like a 10. like a guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> comes over congratulates you unless that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happens no way no way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no i mean it there's how can bowling be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any [ __ ] different in japan to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> other countries </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean there's no rednecks because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to me it just sounds like the you said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the error about it yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then this whole like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay other kind of like bowling places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason universally are like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most like semi-run-down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> places out of any of like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entertainment things i don't know why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bowling's always like places always look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the worst </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean they're always the cheapest you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> know what i mean does anyone understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what i mean but like but the difference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is that like a lot of bowling alleys in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> are run by like round ones yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> they'll usually have like the first like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> usually with like a lot of big round </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ones which is like a huge arcade uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> if you don't know but it's like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first like three floors are like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> arcades and the rhythm games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the next like four floors are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> all the balls i mean to me it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an activity to do when you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> drinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i enjoy it but i it's i do think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the worst activity out of the bunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> why why plenty of time to talk to your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mates you just throw ball every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> few minutes and you get to laugh at your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mate being [ __ ] because either like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> too invested in the bowling and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're not talking right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or nobody's invested in the bowling and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's not the kind of people what do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you mean tell me the perfect level of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bowling ratio to conversation ratio i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should be expecting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because what happens is and and this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happens every single time you got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bowling right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone's talking oh it's my turn but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was in the middle of a fun conversation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't really want a ball so you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] throw her like a meh bowl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because you're already 10 points </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> down you're not gonna win this one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not gonna get a strike let's be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realistic because you're kind of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bowling right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know then someone or sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you okay so then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sorry i'm losing if i'm getting tilted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> over bowling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so then you go up you miss out on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> conversation and it just feels like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like speed dating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the one person is not getting a date </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who keeps going out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> right the rest but i get that if it's if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you're only going bowling with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> your date right if there's only two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> people it's just mate this is mates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you're in a group and then you leave the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> conversation and then no one's really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> giving a [ __ ] about the bowling because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having a conversation yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's an excellent it's just like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just like a background activity yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then what's the point don't do something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> else well that's that's exactly the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as like dumb yeah that's all i have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say is exactly myself like darts or pool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> nah darts you can keep talking while </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're playing darkness you can keep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talking while you're bombing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like what you're gonna do follow him up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the ball </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what are you gonna do follow him up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing like okay okay keep going oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> nice nice ball let's go back now let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go talk okay yeah i do that sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] off i would be like [ __ ] off joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm trying to bowl here don't do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> okay that doesn't make sense because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like i don't give a [ __ ] about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the bowling i only care about the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> conversation right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm bowling right and then when i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talking when it's someone else's turn i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> give a [ __ ] about talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're the most difficult [ __ ] bowler </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i just feel like it's a dichotomy and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> shouldn't exist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like so many activities i can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think of that you know no they're easier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> paul </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while you're doing the pool you can talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while you're doing darts you can talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything else you can do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with that it's because it's like a group </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> activity because we're pulling darts i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> two people that's doing it yeah but you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can do it with like group like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pool you can all sit around the table </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and yeah enjoy it but there's only two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people playing pool right yeah but okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with bowling you know like tag </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's such a distance one too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> much walking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bowling can i just put that out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too much water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to walk far enough away where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't be in the car okay this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> going to sound so [ __ ] dumb all of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> this sounds dumb i realize but you have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to walk far enough away where you are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> leaving the conversation right here but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't have to leave the conference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you are you're laughing you're concerned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if the conversation is like how you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> not going to be [ __ ] far away for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> five minutes you're up there for like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> three seconds that's enough to leave the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> conference i'll be honest i've never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought this deeply about that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought this is definitely about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything in my life except for music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so in your mind are you are you thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this could be optimized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this situation could be optimized this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't this isn't speed running fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know this this is this is fun with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> extra steps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's too much gap between no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> needs that much run up when they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> bowling and if you do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something's wrong with you let's shorten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the distance between where the seats are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and where the alley starts well then but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean you're not gonna have a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 500 meter run up the ball </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right i know some people who are like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> need the full length well then i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want to go bowling with people like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that just sounds like a douche </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're taking this bowling [ __ ] way too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> seriously i just think that bowling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is uh not very optimized sport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for friendship engagement i'm gonna put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just think it's not the best i you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know what can i say gentlemen i mean i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know i've had like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like because okay because i've been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bowling with like i'm sure like some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> people out there that are like conor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> knows what he's talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> he's not monkey brain yeah well they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the kind of people i don't want to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> bowling with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because i don't know there's always </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going to be those comments because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they're going to be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> oh i'm not alone i need to speak up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> finally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also bowling feels like an activity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where i shouldn't have to change my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shoes you know what i mean it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that level of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> activity that isn't serious enough to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> warrant me changing clothes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the shoes part is kind of [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not like you're going rock climbing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right like where it's like i understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i need to bring like you know flexible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> clothing right yeah it feels like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> activity that shouldn't require me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changing clothes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i hate the fact that you always get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the most disgusting rancid shoes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that feel so yeah okay sure they [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spray it they give it a little alcohol </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that does [ __ ] anything this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] is disgusting okay to be fair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> though japan is really good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right with their cleanliness and stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like that i've i've never gotten i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> had that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in australia i don't want to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wear my [ __ ] where's waldo shoes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while i'm talking to my friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eating the most pathetic fries in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> existence that have been half cooked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while we have a half good conversation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and overpriced alcohol </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just think bowling needs to be done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> better and it's depressing as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know why it looks like someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> said childhood or trouble bowling alley </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who hurt you i just show him show me on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the door where okay show me on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doorway show me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> show me on the ball no no no no no no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no because my closing statement on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> board </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay there's a question i need to ask </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you okay because have you had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> bad bowling experiences when you were a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kid or is it something that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know yeah as i become an adult this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> became a thing okay because but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> now that i have that thought now where i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was like you know what i just realized </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because bowling places always had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> arcades right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i had more fun in the arcade </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whenever i went bowling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so what does that say about bowling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> right because you know when you when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you'd have a party with like 12 kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yo you're waiting a long time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel i feel like you don't enjoy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> bowling for the same reason you skip </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stories it's because there's yes like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you could just bowl 10 10 10 balls in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a row and just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then conversation yeah yeah i'm sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you would enjoy it there yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but you're just like scared i think i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> thought i skipped the other part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think because it's like i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're like this but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it's like not my turn i have like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tiny bit of anxiety of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] when's it gonna be my turn i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know it's gonna be my turn what am i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna get called out i don't want to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> serious no i know it isn't but this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the thing someone's not really throwing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> balls </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> somewhere someone out there viewing like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experiences where you're just like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's kind of anxious just not knowing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when we have to [ __ ] stand up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> throw something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i just like to know that okay i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna just do it and then i can come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> back you're treating it like it's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] quick time event like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you can go up whenever you want i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to talk to my homies or play the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> arcades can we separate them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> well then maybe well then maybe you'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> enjoy bowling if that's a one-player </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> by yourself i'd be like finally i get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all of them do you know my best </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> experience bowling was wii sports that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know why no waiting i could just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just just just just just just just just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just just just just just just throw that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> down and it's 100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> optimized yeah yeah and you had that 100 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> pin bolt that [ __ ] was fun as [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> love watching youtube videos people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> getting like a thousand pins yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just amazing it feels good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well then maybe we should do that just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wee bowling yeah he's away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> no no i still gotta wait for you to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your turn i don't like that yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you can skip it if you want skip joey's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> turn skip skip skip </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i feel like talking to you for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> enough times i'm like yeah i kind of get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wonky brain now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's it's starting to make sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm like scientifically dissecting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> how your brain is i just think because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like certainly pool or darts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're constantly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like talking next to each other it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> doesn't really [ __ ] matter when it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my turn but bowling because it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> all right i have to walk up and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you know why don't you walk up with them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and also you know okay i'm not gonna lie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not not a big fan of having to pick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the ball i i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> know i'm kind of sick of doing that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've been there right that one place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you they don't have your [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hand size it's like it's either too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] big where it feels like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're trying to you're trying to grab </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like three [ __ ] food containers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like large or or it's like yes i want my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fingers to be crushed to death and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> potentially just pull my like dislocate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my finger when i throw this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know it because you've been to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> place like that no i haven't [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why i'm laughing because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you must have been you because i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like i'm in a place and you're like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> can't enjoy this bowling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because none of these [ __ ] balls fit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my hand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the one thing i will say about bowling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that no matter ball you choose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somehow it just doesn't feel right it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never feels good like like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you you pick a ball you're like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feels right and then you throw it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh that that that didn't feel good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let me go for the smaller one and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you and you throw it you're like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that feels too light so go for the </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> like i'm in the middle for this like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't hate bowling as much as connor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but if i would like to make a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a tear list bowling's like a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> seat yeah it's definitely the one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> worst </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's like i'm not going to say that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> bowling is like an ester experience or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anything like it's very like a bt for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like the fairy tale of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entertainment sports like it's just mid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> remember i went on a date when i first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> got here and then they wanted to go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> baggage so i was like yeah sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure and in the back of my head i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah i'll take it easy on you and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then i just started like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> destroying them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and now they're like oh man i guess i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> got lucky we started playing darts i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> started just [ __ ] crushing them and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that and i'm like yeah good know your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm joking wow she beat me in darts yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i just i just like does the word casual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like mean anything to you like just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> playing casually that bowling is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> casual player sport i don't like bowling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's cause you can't win in it connor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe that's why because i [ __ ] suck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> at bowling maybe that's why i hate it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah actually i always wanted to ask you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like going back to the monkey brain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing like your opinion on gameplay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we've had a few comments about this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah why don't you like fighting games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is that's probably for you the game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> genre </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that would like on in theory yeah appeal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to you the most yes there's no story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably like the one type of video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> game that i've just never enjoyed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing like why is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've no i think is like the difficulty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> curve is insanely high </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and i feel that like i don't want to sit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there and have to research combos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because sure when i pull one off i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like cool that animation was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fine i guess you know i i just don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like i care enough about like to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> learn these combos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whereas in a game like i don't know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a first person shooter it's so intuitive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that like it's just one bite right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah it is very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone can figure it out but it's that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one simple mechanic that you keep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mastering and you keep getting better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and better and so it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like i've noticed that i really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> only enjoy games where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a easy to learn hard to master type </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of thing and fighting game is just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hard to learn even harder i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fighting games are easy to learn no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff smash maybe yeah smash i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's much more yeah i really enjoy smash </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is fun because i feel that it's just i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's not like [ __ ] tekken where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i have to worry about like the frames in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> spacing and stuff i know i mean like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people in smash worry about that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when you get so high but smash is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> casual game there i said it um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm kidding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i love watching smash competitive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but for me it's a party game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> right oh yeah but that's the great thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> about smash right is that we can be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fun to watch as a party game but it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also a really fun process yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the thing that's really hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> about fighting games is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's hardly ever a party game right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because whenever you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are at a party and people are playing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fighting games there's always that guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or two guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know you know who you are you you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> see people put on like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> smash or tekken and you're like because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they never they never leave that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> couch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they will never leave it if they need to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> piss they're not going they won't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> they'll wait till they get home </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> fighting games don't wait like this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what they've trained like their entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> life for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay let me let me let me smash the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> noobs yeah yeah let me smash all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people at this party and then they need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to find </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other people like them to like continue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on this path that they've put themselves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same people who rock up to an anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> convention just with their like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the gamepad and they're like i know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where i'm spending this yes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's no question about where i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> spending these three days point me to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the room with the the wii u's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because i feel like with fighting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> games it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's i i i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoy watching fighting games more than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i enjoy playing them yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get you get to a point where you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just smashing buttons you're like i kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of get it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you go online or something and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you just get destroyed yeah there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is like the difficulty curve as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you said it's just casual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but to be the difference between a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beginner and a casual is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so [ __ ] massive oh it's huge you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you you go from button mashing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to having to learn like basic theory of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fighting games and basic combos and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> difference between that counting frames </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and like different stuff the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> difference between the beginner and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> casual is so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] like okay for example right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a game of overwatch right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> a pro can be killed by someone who is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> absolutely garbage at the game like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> very plausible that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he could do that right but in a fighting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> game the [ __ ] pros </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> never gonna lose it's not gonna happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i think that that element of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all right well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i just play better most of the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll always win right which is like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because in fighting games there's no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> element of chance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah anyway like especially if you're at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a pro level because they just know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like what's coming and i think that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of fun and that's the kind of stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drives me into like overdrive of wanting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to learn something is that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i had a chance of beating that guy and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could have done it if i just keep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> practicing i'll easily get it right then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i keep going and that's how i got into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> league </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so then maybe if you just gave that a go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with like like street fighter or like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> mortal kombat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i reckon if you learn one fighting game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll be i gotta be honest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i reckon i would be hooked yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why i don't want to because i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> already trying to learn like japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the last thing i need is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> last thing i need is something else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking over my [ __ ] life fair enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> airfare fighting games people i know who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like fighting games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> super chill but their life is fighting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> games like they don't talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> anything else like they're like yeah oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had a nice day oh that's cool i had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a nice day learning the smash combos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like it's like what like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll bring it up when it's not even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the conversation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i love leonardo dicaprio but by the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way sorry [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's what it sounds like sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just incredible he's like leonardo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> dicaprio somehow turn it into smash and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] that's my shame the way i'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> smash my combos it's like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what strike stop i will say like from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the outside looking in the fighting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> game community looks like one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> funnest communities to be in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i love the trash talking the trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> talking is so good and it looks so cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in league of legends they they ban that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i'm like dude i love trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i love trash talking in video games i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> think it's so fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe it's because like the trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> talking in like some of those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> communities just go a little bit too far </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe i mean league of legends is not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> true it's like i'm going to kill you and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your family yeah it's like a legit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> threat sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but i reserve the right to just type to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> someone you're bad like i think that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> come on someone can do it to me i won't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> mind it won't ruin my day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not in a sense that's one of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> worst ways to trash talk right if you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just someone's just typed in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you are bad yeah chad lowercase is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how dare you it's like the worst type of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> insult so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i i competed on the uh like what one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time i did a gaming tournament with my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> universities </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i was like really [ __ ] good at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> cod um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so i you're one of those kids yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> competed on that so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course of course you're a call of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> duty kid yeah so there was this thing uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my gosh i'll just go on this whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tangent then now if you guys are fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i used to when i was like 15 i won a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] ton of cod tournaments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> uh because uh modern warfare three i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know if you've ever played did you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> play modern warfare </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a little bit i stopped at modern warfare </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> too okay so modern warfare 3 had this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing where you could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pay like 40 a year or whatever for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the pass for all the maps and then you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could also go on this website that they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're like tournaments and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> entered one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and they would have a prize for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay first 10 people get uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shot glasses of call of duty which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like later as [ __ ] to anyone who's over </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but fifteen-year-old me was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i could pull my g fuel into the whoa </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i can get something for playing card so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i went to my mates house because i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that my parents would never let me pull </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an all-nighter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bear in mind these tournaments were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> essentially what they were was uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> stat tracking so it would be 24 hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tournament oh wow right of where you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would just it would be like most kills </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in team deathmatch yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so you would just go into a normal team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> deathmatch and just play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it would count how many kills </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you had in team deathmatch before and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how many had so it's basically just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who can get the highest score yeah right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so basically it was like you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] keep playing yeah and i shoot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you not i played [ __ ] like capture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the flag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for like 20 hours straight she's doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this to win these shots like hell to win </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these shot glasses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and i was like crippled after it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it was worth it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i came like i i'd won so many </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> at that time that i was able to go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sleep confidently knowing that no one we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would be able to like overtime yeah all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right i think it came like third or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> won and then and then one what happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> was that it all changed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> they changed it so that it was three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hours now way more manageable yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so i was like sweet i can enter all of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> them and they were like most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flags defended and captured weird [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah so sometimes i would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sitting at my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> base just waiting for someone to take my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> flag kill them get it back and then just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> go back and count </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i would do this [ __ ] i won like 15 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> tournaments or something in the end </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i won so my room was full of short </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> glasses tell you what though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what was the best prize you got ipad pro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> at the time oh wow </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wow ipad when i was like 17 the brand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> new ipad at the time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my mom thought that i was like a drug </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dealer because she was like what the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because all this stuff turned up i won </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> huge poker set wooden poker set they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> only made 250 of them right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i still have it at my house because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't sell it because it was worth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about 700 pounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jesus it's a wood box like this big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you open it up and all these like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wooden poker chips handcrafted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> card decks dealer chips metal immaculate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'll show you pictures i'll be on screen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> right now it's crazy yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> um and i was doing these for ages i won </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> three skateboard decks i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> skateboard what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh a hoodie two coaster sets that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still use actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> metal coasters with like cod skulls on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> them right [ __ ] cringe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> one like wall decals which i couldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] use i sold most of the stuff on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ebay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um but yeah i went on an ipad pro which </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> is the one time yeah and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i got banned from competing why you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so the rules were not well defined </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay and i was uh i don't know how to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> how do i describe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> a sneaky [ __ ] you you you bent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the rules too yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i saw an opportunity so when an ipad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> pro </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm going to take the opportunity to win </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an ipad pro because it seemed all legit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about halfway through these tournaments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i realized okay i'm trying really hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to win these but i think i can also do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it a lot easier </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah so basically what i would do is i'd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> want a bunch of these tournaments and i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> used that like notoriety from those </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> tournaments </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like recruit people to come okay so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it would all it would do is track your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stats right so everyone else on your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> team didn't matter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so if you had a team that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coordinated into making sure that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were the one getting everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right so you so you basically smurfed so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what i did was i got like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these like five swedish players yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for some reason the swedish and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> norwegian dudes were always [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah they were way too good and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> promised them if they helped me win all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these tournaments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i would join their clan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like negotiating online i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> shout you out i will join </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> bear in mind i wasn't worth anything but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to them they were like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's winning all these tournaments yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we gotta get this guy in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so uh did you ever know the game mode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like kill confirmed no no basically a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where you killed someone and they would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drop a tank and you'd have to collect it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so there's one tournament that was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> whoever gets the most kill confirms in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> three hours one yeah so what i did was i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> told these guys i was like hey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kill these dudes and put a marker on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> map of where you dropped it and don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> collect it and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i just ran around collecting them all i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't kill anyone and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was and i should have not done that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because what ended up happening was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> first place was like 1 200 second place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 400. and it raised like a lot of alarm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bells </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't seem fair so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> i got away with it for like two or two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> or three tournaments before people start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> really complaining yeah and people like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this isn't fair he's winning everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because of this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but then the thing was people started </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> doing it right so then it was a matter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of everyone was [ __ ] cheating each </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right and because there were some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> real [ __ ] big boy prizes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was a jeep one of them jesus which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] i was like 10 points off winning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a [ __ ] jeep at the age of 16. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never mind i was i was winning all these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> prizes under my dad's name yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they wouldn't ship it to you if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they also made me fill out tax forms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah which i couldn't even legally fill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> out which i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what did you tell your dad that you were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like filling out i was like dad i've won </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bunch of stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's gonna it's gonna turn up to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> house in a ups fan about 20 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> items i need you to pretend that you won </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> them dad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and they were very visibly like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and then they were like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess yeah yeah and so the thing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got me banned right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from these tournaments yeah there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this one prize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that was you know the movie battleship </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with featuring rihanna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah horrible they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> promoting the movie battleship yeah one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the prizes was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could rent out a whole movie theater </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and take all your friends to get drinks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i thought to myself the amount of street </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cred i'll get from this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> imagine this is an outstanding move that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no one will experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay okay okay okay bear in mind i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to say people might have called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] on this whole thing but i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eight hours a day addicted to cod so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> straight up like it's like made for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do this so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i had was this was a team death </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> match tournament i remember this so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> vividly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and uh in team death manchester to kill </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> them yeah so what i would do is i would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ask my friends to go around with riot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> shields </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and card you ever play it yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> don't kill anyone okay yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you can trap them in a corner tell me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they are i'll come over and pop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> them in the head right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so what we would do is right i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> coordinated it was literally so you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how what what what like incentive did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you give them to like follow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> everything [ __ ] nothing i was keeping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> holding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i was keeping this all to myself i never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever told them once i was gonna help </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them do it right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i was just like i'm just gonna take the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> prizes and you guys can help me they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right it's good that sounds like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> good deal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i do remember thinking so the swedish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> dudes they had a reason right because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i would join their team i did join that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> team and we won a lot of tournaments but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of the other people who helped me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> out had no incentive whatsoever i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> wanted to just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have fun yeah it was entertaining as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] to just go in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and do this yeah and i i won some of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these tournaments on my own but i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> sweating my ass off like i would have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like really play my best and so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thought i'd do that one i can just get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it secured i mean it's in the rules </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> rules i was like why am i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> sweating when i can just guarantee the w </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> right like so yeah i did that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and by that time that implemented a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feature where you could see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a heat map of what was happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right people were starting to see that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 75 kills to me zero zero zero zero with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my teammates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and people were like hmm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't seem like a normal game of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> team death </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he got a nuke and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what happened was that they wanted to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make an example out of me and they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no more doing this no one else is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> allowed to do this we've banned this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from happening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah and so they banned me from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing it and i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i spoke to the other because there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like four of us who won all of these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tournaments right right and the other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 30 year old men who worked in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> construction companies and this is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all they would do in their speed time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i felt bad for them because i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a 15 year old kid being like i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna take the money that you probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> need i don't need this [ __ ] i'm gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> take it i love how they banned you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you kind of became you like v </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for vendetta </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like i wanted to make a statement </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and i got banned for it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was worth it to get the doubles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to this day i was like for the the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> year after that i was so [ __ ] bitter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it wasn't in their [ __ ] rules they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just did it to make an example out of me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the website shut down five months ago </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that website failed five months </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after i was like yeah [ __ ] you wow </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> okay if you wanted to go and track your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you would have to go and do this and you </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> yeah a year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to get access to the tournament man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're that guy who just tries to cheat </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> find them because it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like that's it works smarter right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like why would i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> work harder when i can just do things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> easy right like i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what thought every criminal says </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> so it was i was not cheating there was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no rule against what i was doing and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> they [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they banned me because i was too good at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> their own game i wasn't cheating i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just bending the rules </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i got mad mileage out of that ipad that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was worth it all that ipad was working </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like two thousand dollars yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was amazing and my mom was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> still like even after was like hmm you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> got an ipad yeah you're doing drugs did </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_06> that how you saying drugs on the side </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> are you winning son are you waiting oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was such a fun time that was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> great that was so fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i loved doing that because i just won so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> much i wish i won the good stuff like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the jeeps yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that dude that would have been a mad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> flex if you want to just i was just busy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes yeah i remember the jeep i wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> close to winning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there was one time where they had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> quad bikes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about like you know like 10 grand maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i came [ __ ] fourth and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was for the top three and i came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fourth by draw oh wow so i'd drawn for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it i didn't get it because of that i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so annoyed i was like mom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't get the quad bikes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> would you even be able to use the quad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bikes i suppose in wales in wales yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wait wait wait wait wait wait </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people to sell them yeah i think like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> four of the 30 people in my class had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quad bikes like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone had quad bikes for some reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> those were the guys who like came in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> top three yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like i see you got it that's how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they got it yes i got it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean it was yeah i mean i i think it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would have been problematic if i got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that though because i'm not sure how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> much my dad could have bullshitted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i imagine there would have been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot more forms involved when it came </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a quarterback </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like ups isn't just dropping off a quad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bike insurance and everything right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> did he ever find out how you got those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah they knew they were just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first few tournaments that i said i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> won they didn't believe me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah until because all of the stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turned up at once like these twenty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> except one i think around 15 tournaments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> total right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they all turned up at the same day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the prizes and my mum was like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> complete disbelief she was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you weren't lying what is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wow i wish i could get my mom onto a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> test she probably has a better memory of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it than me because i don't remember it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> very well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you you are the epitome of i am winning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> dad like i literally was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that hyper-competitive kid when i found </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something i really liked it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i would get just insanely good at it i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> wish i could have that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because i like if i found something that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was because because in that sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're very much like a perfectionist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah with that kind of things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not like that i'm just like if i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> good enough then that's good enough for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> me i can never be like that with stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but the problem is if i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if i don't have that drive i kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't care about anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because like it's so fleeting for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me when it comes to gaming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i i in every kind of like competitive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i always have this like honeymoon period </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're just learning the game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just fun yeah and then when you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> start playing ranked like ranked for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> few months are like yeah this is this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty fun and then you get to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you hit the wall you hit the wall and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that's for me when it stops getting fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's that for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is when you it starts becoming like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> nine-to-five grind you know what i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like i'm not even having fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> grinding anymore this feels like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this feels like another job i'm getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like angry for some reason over a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] video game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> [Music] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i was one game away from being in master </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tier at tft </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i've only been playing it for like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> month and i was like i'm going to be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] pro at tft yeah i'm actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be a pro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and then i i got demoted and i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lost all interest in the game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like to get better the amount of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mind power i'd have to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like exert too much i'm like i can't do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> this yeah and you realize like to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ten percent better would take like eight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> hours a day of playing it's like yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i can't do it i'd rather be just like an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> average joe at like a lot of different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> things rather than excel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at like a couple of things i think i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> think i'm the opposite i think that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what i've been i've been like really bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> at a lot of things in my life yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the things that i do like you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> [Applause] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> when i'm into something i rarely think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about anything else right yeah like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> only want to do this one thing and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna do it as much as possible right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until i'm bored of it and then when i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bored of it i pretty much never come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> back to it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's weird every episode just like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the monk just gets like yeah i know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people are gonna i know because </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> uh back like i think there's just i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know if it's like obviously not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you but with jujo do you have like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> blank period in your life where you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like don't remember much of it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's just because i was doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> drugs i'm sorry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there you go if i'm if i'm to be frank </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with you that's exactly why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> all right like are you keeping that in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mind i'm okay with that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's the truth i don't remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything okay because there was the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when we were talking about how you were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> getting into anime yeah and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think you you mentioned that there's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i can't really say why that i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> stopped watching anime yeah like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was it was he jacking up obviously is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that what he was like was he like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was it like selling his body for sex </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like what was it it's like no i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing drugs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's i'm just gonna put it out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not hard drugs no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i just like to pinpoint that not hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drugs but yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's but that's the thing right like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's where i had that blank of just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i wasn't really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> doing anything with my life and all i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was really doing was like playing music </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or like playing games but not to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> extent that you were playing games i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on new grounds playing the bullshittest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like dumbest [ __ ] flash games that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have ever existed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i guess for me like the only thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i've i've been super invested in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like my career now which is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube and yeah i do think of youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as a game yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's totally a game it's totally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gamified yeah yeah that's pretty why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've been able to like you know i guess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess because like i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like the way i see it is kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have [ __ ] optimized youtube game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know how i feel i think that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there are many aspects that it shares </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right unfortunately yeah i mean there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still a huge creative aspect of it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think there's ways to like iterate on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yourself that are very game-like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's like you do i feel like social </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> media in general is a game yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you look at something like twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where i think i remember i watched this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> series by this guy called charlie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> brooker who made he made a series called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the top </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most influential video games of all time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right and he put number one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was twitter and like when and at first i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like what what the [ __ ] you talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about twitter is in the game and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you think about it where like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah you uh play an avatar online to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh farm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> numbers and the more like the more you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get into it the more numbers you farm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know he's he's kind of got a point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because like he's right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nobody really you're like playing a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> version of yourself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's not like you don't show all of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yourself online no one ever does show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> themselves online yeah you gotta </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> optimize every tweet you make right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> should i do i phrase it in this way like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is this funny thing to tweet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know how some people can [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tweet like 50 tweets in a day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't think i have 50 tweets like 50 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thoughts in the day let alone like 50 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're do you ever get those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> moments you're like i want to find that </SPEAKER_02>
