<SPEAKER_00> give me a 15 minute buff up trying to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> professional trying to be great so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> call this taxi right and it's like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like a Japanese kind of uber version app </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it normally takes at most 15 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> so I schedule a taxi or whatever it is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> the point is that I'm like buffering on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> buffers right so I call the cab at 12 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 30. it's a 20 minute Journey so I have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> plenty of time if it's like the maximum </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I I might even get there completely far </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> too early right so I I get the app and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's and I I call the taxi and Boom at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 12 30 I have a taxi driver who's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> arriving in 15 minutes yeah that's a 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minute Journey so the taxi should arrive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at 12 45 and then I'll get there at 105. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right a little bit early but fine it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fine okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I have 15 minutes so I go and I go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and brush my teeth I go and start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting ready and I go and check my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> phone 10 minutes later and he hasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> moved it's still 15 minutes away and I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> can see that he's beginning he's been </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going up and down this one road and I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like I'm sure it's nothing I'm sure I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sure it's fine </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> listen I'm sure I'm sure you know he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> just got a little lost on this one road </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it's a main road you know maybe you just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> couldn't get off it right it's no big </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> deal sure I should have canceled right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then and there I most certainly should </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> have and I so regret it right I had the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought in my head I'm sure this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing right and I should have listened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to myself and realized this was a sign </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of things to come so to to get to my my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I am there's a series of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> one-way roads that are a bit confusing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they they have to enter at this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> certain point if they don't enter at a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> certain point it's like it adds five to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ten minutes of [ __ ] to try and get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back to where I am right yeah so he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coming up to it and I'm waiting outside </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and if he gets if he gets this turn you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can comes to me I'm ready to go of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> course he [ __ ] misses it just goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right past it even though the navigation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> tells him where to go and I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever it's fine okay it's almost like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> GPS's were invented for a reason I know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I know I know there are a lot too far </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> there are a lot of times tribes in Japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> who take GPS as a suggestion yeah um so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's whatever it's happened before I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not a bit it's not a big deal yeah a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> circle around he'll come but it adds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five minutes right yeah so again so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're all he's already 10 minutes later </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than he's supposed to be and now it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five minutes so what he should have been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here 15 minutes now it's 30. so and now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just about be on time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so he he finally gets here and you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I I understand sometimes they can't find </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the exact location where you tell them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to pick you up from [ __ ] didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even try he was like three blocks away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then press the I'm here button so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I had five minutes to get to him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> otherwise it starts it cancels it or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> charges me money yeah yeah so I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] so I'm rushing to get to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> him and then I finally get to the car </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like one minute remaining on this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> timer otherwise my journey gets canceled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I get charged money yeah and he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> not even in the [ __ ] car </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> he's a gun somewhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> walking around like where where is this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> guy yeah so I'm just sitting there and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then finally he comes and I he obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> realized that he [ __ ] up so he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> around looking for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah yeah whatever whatever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> okay it's a bit weird a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uncomfortable and I've got a shoot to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to and I I this is a very precisely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> timed thing that I can't miss yeah we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have one hour and everyone's waiting on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> me it's and like the venue that we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> filming at is gonna open at three so we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only have that one hour window to film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sure so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like whatever it's fine I'll be on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time this is weird and so I get in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> car </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this is when I started to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he kind of just sits in the in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> driver's seat for about 30 seconds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and he goes oh where are you going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like what okay what are you where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> am I going I'm like it's on the app and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like I pull out my phone I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's on the app when I ordered you on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and this guy wasn't a normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taxi driver because he didn't have in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan if you're a taxi driver there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got to be a bunch of identification yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff on the window to kind of let </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know who who's driving you and what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> company they work for in case you have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> complaint or something you didn't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any of that so it was clearly a private </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hire only right so this guy only works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through this app and maybe he's new or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> something or I don't know and I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever it's fine yeah I'm like well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah look at the app I said use the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> navigation on the App please and you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> telling him how to do his job where do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> we go to be fair a lot of the taxi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> drivers like to clarify that you put the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right address yeah yeah because I've had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it where I've put it in wrong yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll correct him and I'll be like oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually no it's here yeah this didn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seem like that but it wasn't like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at all yeah so I'm like I'm like show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> them the fun I'm like oh this navigation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> please use this one right so he grabs my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> phone even though he has it on an iPad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> right here that is much bigger than my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> phone it starts basically zooming in on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I told him to go right and I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> telling him I'm like oh oh no no that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not going to help you because I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like a it's in like a really weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Alleyway yeah it's like it's not going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to help you and so he's looking at it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> frantically zooming in and he's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I don't know where this is I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> well that's why you listen to the air </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's why there's a GPS telling you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> where to go I know you know again I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being polite about it I'm like all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this is whatever and be quite quiet I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just telling her I just kept telling him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like please use the app yeah please use </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the app navigation and and so and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's he's trying to read the address on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing and it's because it's in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> English I'm like I I tell him the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> address yeah and so now he starts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> putting it in and I'm like again I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remind him like you can just use the app </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just use the app like it's right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it tells you where to go and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put the address in but put it in wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my God I'm like no that's wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not where I'm going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the address I'm sorry I'm trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like kind of like talk him through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this yeah and he finally gets the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> address right and then he puts it in on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his iPhone and I it was really odd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I was trying to speak to him in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese but he clearly didn't speak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much Japanese either okay uh he I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he was Chinese right because I heard his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like iPhone telling him his stuff it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really confusing right um and I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever well I mean we're both trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to figure out a halfway language here to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> communicate first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he finally finally starts the car and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's put the navigation in and now I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be just on time if things go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right right yeah but he's been taking so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long to get started in this car that a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> giant truck has parked in front of us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's a car behind us and this guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is clearly not confident enough to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of this parallel park situation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so he just kind of sits there for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five minutes okay I'm getting to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> point where I'll drive [ __ ] it just give </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me I'll get it I'll do it so waiting for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five minutes yeah to get out for to wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for one of these guys to move like he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could have if he wanted to he wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> be like faster about it he could have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> asked the guy in front to move up a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> little bit but I think he was a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nervous I seemed really nervous about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and so finally the car behind us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> moves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and now he has to reverse and for some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason this is like a hard task he can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reverse the car </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just not happening and I'm sitting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there awkwardly listening this beep beep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we're just not moving okay he's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking behind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking behind look at the screen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking behind for about the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> awkward two minutes of my life right but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he keeps looking behind and not moving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and then he goes ah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> restarts the car I'm like what is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's happening what is happening did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> he literally just do a turn and off and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> on again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he restarts the car right and then now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we reverse and I'm like okay this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird so we start driving and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> shooting I would run about 30 seconds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's fiddling with something on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> iPad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's looking at this iPad non-stop all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and suddenly get a notification on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my phone your ride has ended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's that what did it just give up I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think he accidentally pressed end right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> right and now I'm like what happens now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because he just started driving right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and now I'm like uh uh uh and so he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> starts driving and I'm trying to figure </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> out what the [ __ ] do I do like I'm yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like I don't know if I'm gonna be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> late where's he going yeah yeah I'm like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> does he need so he has to he has the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> navigation in his phone right but I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like I'm like worried now he ended the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ride on Uber right yeah basically so I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like what what happens now like I didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know what to do and I was trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figure out what I said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and so I I was thinking like man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what should I do should I just like let </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> him keep driving or should I should I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ask him to stop at some point like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because because they've already been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> charged yeah like the full amount of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> trip is like it's prepaid right yeah so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've already been charged for it so he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> has to take you there yeah but he on his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing it'll say that like he didn't take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me there so it's really like I'm I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just unsure what to do because I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty sure I'm not gonna be able to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a refund yeah so I'm kind of like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] it I'm sure he'll get me there and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this won't be a problem yeah I should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have got the [ __ ] out of the car right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so right to leave my house there is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can go straight and it'll turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around and there's a or there's a right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turn you can do oh sorry a left turn you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can do right away yeah and he has to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just go straight right and of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just immediately turns and I'm like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no even though the sat nav is telling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> him to just go straight he just ignores </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it right and I'm like oh no oh no this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is going to keep happening isn't it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I [ __ ] you not every single turn he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ignored okay every single one and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the writers were pulling out of my place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go onto a main road he nearly hits a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> car like straight up like this car's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going really fast and he's just going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into traffic and I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a genuine like a fearing for my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now this guy can't listen to the sat nav </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he seems to be [ __ ] up everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and can't reverse can't reverse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> nearly driving into traffic and he he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> refuses refuses to listen to his own </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> navigation okay and it is stressing me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> out because now I'm I see that every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> single turn he misses two minutes adds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> up right right four minutes five minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ten minutes he there was one point where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he just had to keep going straight and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he just decided to turn and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realized he [ __ ] up and added on five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> minutes trying to do a U-turn and I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I'm gonna die like what what why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> though like I don't know did he think it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> was like oh I'll take this foreign </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it seemed as if he would only take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> turns </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> from what I noticed if they were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> clean corner turns right like if he had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to go into traffic to do wide turns yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> he wouldn't take it he would ignore it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right and I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should you does he have a driver's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> license yeah yeah kind of sounding like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he doesn't have a driver's license </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> running through my mind right and so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> he's like zoolanders like I can only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> turn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's literally like Zoolander </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> he would only do the like the if you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in America like the right turns yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah he wouldn't do any turns that were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wide and kind of into traffic yeah I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just making me like I'm like oh my God </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy is like so instead of just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going straight to my destination on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> map he's doing like this right only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing like back alleys and small turns </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right and at one point he's he he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realizes right that the the ride has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been ended right and so he keeps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fiddling with the iPad looking at it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's driving the whole time and it's on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his chair on the passenger seat so it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not like he's looking looking at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something on the dashboard like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my God and and at multiple points we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were like in full-on moving traffic and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and you know I politely asked him I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was like hey um can you look at the road </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because I was like this is Beth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like at one point yeah we were it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the traffic had backed up so we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were like we weren't near the lights we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were in the middle of the road there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of traffic and all the cars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> started going and for about five seconds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he was still looking at the iPad now to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like excuse me excuse me you've got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go yeah and he was like oh oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry sorry sorry it was this whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> awkward mess where he just everything he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could have possibly done wrong he did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> wrong everything everything and this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this was supposed to be a taxi ride </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that went for how long it was a 20 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> minute ride yeah and the taxi ride </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> itself not including all the [ __ ] we had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before yeah it ended up being 15 minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so from 20 minutes to 50 minutes because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he just kept taking all the wrong turns </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah and we and just walked there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah honestly honestly and at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end of it I was just like dreading that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was gonna be like hey the ride ended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are we gonna have to fix this yeah and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was just like the whole time I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please please just let me out of this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taxi you don't keep me in here and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talking to me I was just terrified that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was gonna have to like have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> confrontation with him right about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I just didn't want to obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's had [ __ ] to do yeah and luckily we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> finally got there and he was the one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time he was going to listen to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> navigation was when it was actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be less efficient for my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> journey and I was like no no just just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> keep going straight keep going straight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> please please please and it's right as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were getting to the end and thank God </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he listened and he let me out and that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the end of it but oh my God I was so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stressed because I was late to my shoot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by 20 minutes yeah and I had to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> just fumble my way into it and get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> started right away right yeah bro damn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Nightmare and I hate I hate rating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people poorly on these apps because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you know I'm like maybe it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just a one-off maybe it is right maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this didn't sound like it was a one no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it sounded like this guy yeah I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> afterwards I was like no I can't I can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no excuse in my mind that can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> justify how much this guy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> everything out I mean if he told me he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was an alien who just landed on those </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yesterday I would believe it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and so the whole ride in the day I was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just trying to figure out like what was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that dude's deal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> what was up with this I mean I've you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> know I've been in a couple of Taxi rides </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> where you know it's usually because you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know yeah yeah yeah you know Japanese </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> taxi is usually like an older gentleman </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you know who is like very much like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> anti-technology and he's like no no no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I've lived in this area for 60 years I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know the road's better than any sack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and then you know they clearly miss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a very simple turn yeah but like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't seem like that yeah it seemed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like he'd I don't know if he just moved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> here recently or something and he wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> familiar with the roads and maybe he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> scared of using them and it might have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just started but either way I knew I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> mean you shouldn't be driving taxes if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're scared of the road no there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a minimum requirement to a job </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of just being a taxi driver even if it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> is kind of like I don't know because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's kind of like the app is kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like uber but I don't know what their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> requirements for [ __ ] uh clearly none </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I know I know that it's you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> becoming a taxi driver in Japan is not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hard but I mean it's not hard already </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anywhere </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um you live long enough </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> we're gonna see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know you know not to blame the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> foreigners </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I felt bad for the guy because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he clearly seemed like he was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> overwhelmed and I know I hate piling on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] people who already look like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're not handling stuff well yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> at the same time it's like there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> limit yeah there's a limit to what I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think is like you should not be doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this yeah like you and also your life is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in your his hands yeah the moment he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> nearly crashed is when I was kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like all right this is too much now yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like this is like I I I I you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're actively like a danger yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not only are you awful at this job from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like an efficiency standpoint you are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> actively like harmful like damn we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> haven't been back in Japan for a while </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it seems like you've already gone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> into some like [ __ ] yeah yeah I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know because sometimes uh in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like more often not public transport is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> quicker but depending on where you live </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and how the roots are sometimes you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> might have to change like three or four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> times for a 30 minute Journey yeah of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> course and the taxi will be one ride 15 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes boom you're right there yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so a lot of the time like I'll just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do that because like I don't want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> have to deal with it especially if it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you know 15-20 minutes away right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> most of the time if you go via app </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's when you like don't [ __ ] up you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know because you can time it perfectly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because the driver always follows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the app you know it's it's for the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> part for the most part you know a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the times it's very common if you get in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the taxi in Japan they'll and you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ordered it on an app they'll be a firm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll be like are you going here and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you say yeah and then they'll be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool and they they'll they I get this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> ass quite a lot they'll be like do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want me to use the navigation in the app </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah yes please yeah I put it in for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it's been like no no no I I trust </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yours Yeah because sometimes the app </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't like include highways and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> highways and tolls and so they have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> manually add the toll costs onto the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> price that you didn't see right so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that you might not know if you're not in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> living in Japan using taxis often yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the taxis have some form of etiquette </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and you mean it's it's a bit different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from like New York and other places in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the world yeah but I feel if you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> visiting and stuff you know the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> train system is 99.9 full proof so oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah the trip might be a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you know longer and more tedious </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if you need to like change </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> train stations on the way but for the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> most part it's fairly simple yeah if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need to get somewhere fast and from a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> location there's not a train station </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> taxis are like often very of course yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well I I feel like if you know if if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know how to like talk to a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taxi drivers I actually feel like trains </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for sure for sure yeah because taxi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drivers will ask you like a lot if it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not like a train station or if it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a major Monumental that's that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the one thing I hate about catching a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taxi in Japan it's like when whenever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like I missed like I mean you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I missed the last train yeah taxi home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and then you know I tell them like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I need to go and he puts it in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sat nav and then he's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> um so do you want me to go down like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this specific route and I'm like I don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] know I get that as well because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like sometimes I get a taxi and they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like um I'm thinking about going this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> way do you know if I can do that or not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like I'm not the [ __ ] taxi driver </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know my way I always just say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please use whatever navigation tool you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> have I I tell them my simple trick is I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just tell them go the shortest drought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah I'm like I don't care just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just take me home I need to be home </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right because sometimes if it's not on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an app and you just call a taxi they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> don't put it in the SAT like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> navigation but they'll ask you like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] 20 questions and be like can I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> go this way I'm like it's two in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> morning I'm shit-faced I don't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> where I am I just want to be home just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> take me home unless it's like a very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well-known Monument or a place I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> normally always just say hey can you put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the address and then they'll pull up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the SAT and everything yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and then just read it out to them that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty useful I have uh I have a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> similarly like kind of funny story uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that happened just the other night um so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know we just got back from a tour </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which we'll obviously talk about later </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> in the show yeah but um you know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted to like catch up with some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friends because I haven't seen them in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> while right and we're doing a meet-up uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Syria and uh this is like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a couple of izakayas that me and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my group of friends like going to you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know just for a big group meet up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's you know it's especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like on like a Friday night or whatever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> most isakizen is in inches yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [Music] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I know of a couple of like you know kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of hidden spots that usually are quite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> free even on weekends so we went there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know we were just like drinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chatting away and we were the only ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there to begin with right and we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh this is great we got the whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place to ourselves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and then just like I don't know maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two three hours into the night uh this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> huge group of people just start walking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I want to say like 50 to 100 people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus just like all like you know yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like five people at a time and that's 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people and then it's five people and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then before you know it this entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place is packed with people just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> standing around drinking and stuff like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um you know but it's like whatever we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got the we got our seats we're having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> fun it's all good yeah and then about 20 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> minutes in I just kind of like noticed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like man it's really quiet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> why is it so quiet and I'm looking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> around and it's still full of people but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like really quiet yeah almost to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the point where we're the only ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> talking and then in the corner of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bar I see the sign in Japanese that says </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> buy yearly meet and drink Meetup for the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Deaf </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I noticed every single person in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this bar other than us is talking in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Sign Language oh wow and I'm like that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> why it's so quiet because literally no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> one is talking and everyone is just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> saying it that's awesome and and it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bad but like the first thing in my mind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I thought of was well I hope we're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not being too loud </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the only thing you don't have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> worry about now well it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> immediately like oh [ __ ] oh wait no we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> good but it was really cool because it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like you know I I knew a couple of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people in school who were like deaf and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stuff like that but like I'd never seen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that many deaf people in a social </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> setting like a little on a bar right and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's like signing to each other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there are people on like uh video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> calls to each other and they're signing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to each other and I'm like this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really freaking cool but it's also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really weird because it's so packed and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yet it's so quiet yeah and you all you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hear is just like the rustle of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clothes moving around and stuff if it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but so yeah that was a that was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really interesting time I guess I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now you know if you come to Tokyo you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to shibia there's a buy yearly meeting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> for the deaf apparently so uh I like how </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> video yeah I mean I've been out like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a bunch since coming back to Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like I definitely noticed one one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> thing I've noticed now is that before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now that because before everyone knew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you were living in the country right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every everyone knew you were living in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the country because the borders were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> closed but now that the borders are open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen like a total mentality change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right because now now before when I go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a restaurant everyone's like oh you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know where'd you live how long have you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been living here now people are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> panicking because they're like is it a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is it a tourist or is it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese they're speaking to me back in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> English now they're like all right well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a white guy yeah I think I went I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> went to this restaurant the other day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with Sydney and they literally asked us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> oh God uh are you visiting and we're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like no we live there and they're all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh it's a Japanese menu okay for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you because you know some places don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have an English menu yeah we said yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> we've lived here before Japanese menu </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um so we go sit down they give us the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> English menu anyway even though we said </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I've had that having me so many times </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the waitress comes up to me and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> just like oh English is okay and I reply </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> back in Japanese you know being like no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> no Japanese is fine yeah I live around </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> here and it's just like oh okay comes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> back and she's like he's the Englishman </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> just in case I'm like [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just talked to you in Japanese I'm good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can read it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> getting our bags and this guy goes I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna bother you guys but I'm a big fan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> appreciate that yeah no just like I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> sure you you two have noticed as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but just like oh bro yeah exponentially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> just more people yeah I mean we did this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> uh I did this irol stream with Chris and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Pete and uh yeah it was uh insane we had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so many more stream snipers oh yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> was insane I did I did notice an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> interesting thing though where at least </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> with me uh I immediately know if someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is a fan of like the anime man or if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> someone is a fan of trash taste yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> because I know they're a fan of trash </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> taste because they come up to me and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they go are you Joey </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but if they're a fan of me they go are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you the anime man and then that's where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like okay I know exactly like which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> mode to switch to anyone want to talk </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> about and stuff because I had that exact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> same experience like maybe 10 minutes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> apart like one day because my parents </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were visiting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and you know I go recognized a bunch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was out and about and yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like 10 minutes apart there was one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dude who was like are you the anime man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> never heard of trash taste never heard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything about trash [ __ ] just knows me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the end ten minutes later American </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> dude stops me and goes yo Joey what's up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> man I just missed out on the trash taste </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> toy and I'm like yeah it's it's really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting kind of like the the dynamic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> between like the I guess the two fan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> bases if that makes sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> um but yeah I mean I mean I can tell as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> well because it's like the gig up or the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guns you know how do they refer to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes they just they just mistake me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for Joey which happens a lot there he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goes I love the other Asian guy in trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> taste I was like which one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> which one were you referring to are you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about the full Asian guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like all right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's cool though because I felt like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of the bars and restaurants feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they kind of returning to normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> almost yeah yeah it's like it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nice the world is healing there has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> literally been like a switch I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> noticed that with like all these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> restaurants and bars yeah yeah just it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so much more alive now yeah and they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> so much more like down for foreigners to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> come in yeah yeah it's crazy how night </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and day it swapped it's like they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> actually prepared you know for you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> for more foreigners to come in well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I'm sure as a business owner </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you're probably just like frothing for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the foreigners to come back yeah I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know there's only so many times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean some of them are probably just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh God here they come again but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> others are just like oh thank God we can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually get customers in now yeah not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have to rely on the same three local </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> people that come back every week right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's been nice and now my favorite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing now is seeing all the tick tocks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of like this crazy thing I found in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan it's like a really it's a really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like well-documented tourist thing yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah believe it it's like all right this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is the craziest idea this is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> craziest Cafe that I found in Shinjuku </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's like all the same place </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not trying to be like talking dirty </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just funny it's just funny I I find </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it fun as well because I I get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> recommended those tick tocks sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well where it's just like this is how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> life in Japan works and it's like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> vending machines keep the [ __ ] drinks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I actually thought I saw that one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like eight amazing things that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> made Japan so convenient yeah I remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I saw one the other day which is like </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_02> did one tester show in L.A then flew to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Minneapolis and got on the tour bus yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was so much cooler than I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> any of us expected oh it was so cool I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know I thought I was kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> dreading the tour bus and you know we've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got a lot of questions about like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that I'm scared for the tour yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm just like expecting yeah I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to be leaving with this with these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> guys and much of strangers for like 40 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> days I don't know how I feel about that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was actually like really really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nice really really comfortable and a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of fun as well yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um because it kind of felt like after </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the road trip special which is now out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thankfully like I was I was dreading </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it was going to be 41 days of just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm literally gonna kill one of the boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuck in this space but like the tour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> bus actually gave you like quite a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of space and quite a lot of like time to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> do I think it definitely helped that the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> majority of the traveling that happened </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on the bus was happening while we were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> asleep yeah so it was like traveling </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah it was like Fast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> traveling in RPG it's great because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people were asking us oh how's how's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drive been how's the roads been and we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were like literally uh we we blink in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one place and we wake up in another yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only roads I think we any of us saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were like the roads between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> um I think Colorado and uh I guess Vegas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and all that stuff and a lot of Nevada </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was the only part I think we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> awake while we were traveling yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even then it was like what an hour or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> two in the morning yeah you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually spend a lot of time on the bus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as you think so the normal day would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you wake up you've arrived at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the new place you pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> immediately get off the bus so your bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like a capsule hotel but stacked and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's 12 of you yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then you get off the bus shower </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you go get lunch then maybe you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wait around then do sound check at three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you'd have to wait for like an hour </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or two then we do the Q a before the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show at six yeah and we wait and then I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> finished at seven wait one hour eight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we finish the show around 10 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 30. we maybe have a celebration on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bus yeah we're drinking talking until </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like two and then we go to bed and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bus moves yeah that's kind of every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> single day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that was basically our schedule uh our </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> life was just living on a bus or in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> green room and I'd like I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about you guys like a lot of people were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like scared about would I get good sleep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the bus I got [ __ ] fantastic sleep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I got better sleep on the bus than I did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in some hotels it was a nice role for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some days I did some days I didn't it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was mainly like because I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about you guys but I realized that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sleeping on a moving vessel while I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> needed to pee was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I had to go pee like at least two three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> times a night and normally normally I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> don't ever have to pee when I'm sleeping </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> right right so this was like oh my God </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm getting so stressed out that's how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> old men feel I felt like I was I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> rapidly aging yeah um but some nights I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would get amazing sleep because the bus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of rocks you like like it's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> engine hum is so loud and also there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> AC in the sleeping like quarters yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah there's a giant AC unit that is so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> loud and ventilation system yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> then so you cannot hear anything from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> anyone else's bunk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um so it was surprised like because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I remember the first time we got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> on this bus and we saw how close of a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proximity all the beds were to each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other yeah I was like oh I don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's gonna be any privacy like I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna be able to hear everyone [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff nothing it's literally like in you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> know when you fall asleep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was perfect because even though the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> AC in like the engine were really loud </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> they acted at like the perfect white </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> noise like if if you've ever like slept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> with like a white noise like filter or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something in the background that's kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of what it felt like where you couldn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hear anyone snoring you can hear anyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like rustle around or anything like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just heard a constant white noise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was constant throughout the night </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I sleep great on moving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> vehicles I don't know about you guys but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when the bus I slept better when the bus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was in motion than when the bus was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> still although I must say our bus driver </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> did get a little wacky crazy at some of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> the locations like there were some turns </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> where he did where I almost fell out he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> only fell out yeah I had to like hold on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to being like Jesus [ __ ] crazy and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> then obviously when you get into the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> cities because you're stopping and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> starting so much good traffic because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the highways are just you're going yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the cities are stopping and starting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> so you're like you know your body's sort </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of coming out of the Sleep Cycle anyway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you're kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of the time yeah yeah so like to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> explain this bus it was it we call it a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> bus it's more like a coach you know what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean because when I say when I say bus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think like double decker bus no it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a like a single Decker like coach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of thing and then you go into the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you go into the coach and then the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing you see is like this living room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> area where you've got like a bunch of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you got like sofas on either side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a table in the kitchen and stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um three TVs scattered all yeah three TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scattered around permanently playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] SpongeBob or some [ __ ] whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was on American TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and then you go into the next room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there are 12 bunk beds and there are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like three three stacks three layers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> basically three layers so there's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bottom layer there's the middle layer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's a top layer and according to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like most people you get the best sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the middle layer right so me and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor chose the middle layer Joey chose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the top layer yeah which kind of scared </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me because if you fall out of that bed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean you know I only chose the top </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> bunk because I'm a child at heart and I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was like oh yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> but no like you know I I still got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> really good sleep on the top it was fine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah and then there's one extra </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> room in the back which was meant to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the talent room but that just that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> just turned into let's just put all our </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> shits into this one room yeah and it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like unusable yeah I guess in like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normal tour yeah like the the talent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have their own like private quarters if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like one Talent apparently some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of the two buses have the like a room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like a bedroom as well oh okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah right I mean that would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> be cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and and you know for the most part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like we didn't really utilize that room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it kind of just became like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> storage space just yeah because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I mean you know when when Aaron uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who helped organize the store shout out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to Aaron by the way um you know was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know by the end of this tour these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guys who you think are strange just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right now who are going to be with you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on this bus they're going to end up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like family yeah and like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I always thought when I heard that from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like multiple people uh you know who've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> done tours before I just thought it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know just some kind of like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know it's not excuse type of thing but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know just like I think that maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not everyone can relate to that type of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing right but like I don't know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know about you boys but like by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the end of the tour it was like a family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right and we got really close to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the the stuff that we had and we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> always just like hanging out with them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in that front section and so we were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like we don't have to use this bathroom </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> let's just go hang out with everyone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> else obviously you want to hang out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there real yeah they're always hanging </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> out with everyone this was a good time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so there's actually there was actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more people than I thought they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to be living on the bus with us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like prior to the tour because we only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knew probably we were gonna have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some Geeks uh Geeks plus staff members </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and some people from the tour company </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we worked with I was thinking okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's gonna be like a manager someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like stagehands I like didn't take into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> account just how much staff is needed to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> run a tour because there's like there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like multiple merch people and there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like managers and everything like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's our staff as well on top of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that and you know there's the technical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people as well there were like so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people on this tour bus with us and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought [ __ ] this is this is gonna be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot for 41 days but like it was such a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nice experience because luckily everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was chill and we'd pretty much got along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with everyone yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and it was just I don't know you guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you guys said it kind of felt like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> holiday in some cases yeah it did I I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely treat it as a holiday well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because like we I normally work way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> more than that so only doing like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two-hour show and then having the rest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the day where I can't really do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> anything it's kind of like oh okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like you know there were some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> days where like we had to stop by kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> of halfway between two places because uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> legally our bus driver could only drive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a certain amount of hours per day so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah there were some days where we would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> stop buying just like the middle of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nowhere get a day hotel and then just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know go and explore type of thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and in my head I'm like okay before the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a toll I planned out these days of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the days that were at the hotel yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we could get like our own room and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could like you know yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> catch up to work and stuff like that but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> then when it actually happened I was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like no I think I'd rather just go out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with everyone and like actually go see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this part of the country that yeah let's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> be real probably not going to go back to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah like when am I ever gonna go back </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> to Biloxi Mississippi yeah you know so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] I've had a great time there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> actually I had a great [ __ ] time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> there yeah yeah that was great I I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> actually really enjoyed the days off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah definitely appreciate how much work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> goes into doing these you know when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to a venue and you watch a show with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like with a thousand people or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah maybe you realize just how many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moving Parts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know a lot of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> um were like damn why don't they come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into my place or whatever it's like well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's very [ __ ] difficult to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> organize a tour yeah and it kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sucks a lot of people like why the US </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um well the US isn't a very unique place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it is actually like built for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tours yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um you know a lot of the time when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're moving merch across borders and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how a lot of these shows I didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realize this either a lot of these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> concerts only make like most of their </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> profits through the merch yeah like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ticket sales you don't actually get that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> much money because a lot of the cot like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the venue's expensive everything else is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> expensive all the staff like yeah you as </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> the like talent and the the kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> agency or whatever you don't make much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> money from the tickets yeah and the US </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is in a prime position where you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> actually drive around all the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> country where all the same like rules </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with selling merch it's all the laws </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I think we learned a lot just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from doing this us all because there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were a lot of complaints being like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they they've had they hate the entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> world because everyone just goes to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> us so we did one show in Canada and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think like the only time we got like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> negative feedback from our show yeah was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from that one show in Canada and that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was to do with there was like we we had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the show in Canada and uh we didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realize that there were different laws </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in terms of bringing merch across the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> border different law of hiring staff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> members because all staff members need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be hired locally and there was a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of logistical things that just weren't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> within like our Radars when we sorted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> out we didn't know that we didn't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that but obviously the tool company knew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that but obviously still you know trying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to get like the merch shipments to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> arrive on time I didn't realize this was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a problem but yeah that that's a whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing yeah that's that needs to be taken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> care of so yeah a lot of the times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're kind of hoping that all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> moving pieces should work sometimes they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't and it's like what do we do yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah we ended up like shipping 12 boxes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of merch to our Canada show and one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> arrived and then we had one day to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as much merch made locally in Canada as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we could unfortunately it wasn't as much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> merch as we had in our us shows but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's kind of like the things that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people don't think about and don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about because you know when uh you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you do a tour in multiple countries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every country has their own laws every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> country has their own taxes it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just getting people from One venue to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> another you know it's uh what we're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trying to say is hate the game not the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> player obviously it can be done these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people do it but it's just it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> harder it is our first tour the US makes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of sense yeah this was also our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> first tour as well so we had so many </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> things that I guess we just didn't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> until it happened I mean thankfully I'd </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like to say that the tour was a massive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> success I didn't see any negative </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> reviews no I'm so glad because like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we one of the biggest things I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worried about pre-tool was that we'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start doing like shows and people would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know I've seen feedback before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like you know people that have gone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on tours and you know I've seen the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feedback of just like oh it wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really worth the money I spent all this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money seeing it just wasn't really worth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it and I'm like thankfully it felt like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone had a good time and we put on a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> good show that we brought to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different places and I was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after I think it was like after the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> first show that I actually had like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> faith in our show I guess because well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we had the outline of the show and we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't actually we'd never rehearsed and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we didn't really know how it was going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go until the rehearsals which was two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> days before yeah our actual show yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like our show relied so much on like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> crowd interaction and having a rehearsal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of like five people versus like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the thousand people that we had in our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> actual show was like night and day in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> terms of like Vibe and chemistry and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um so I was going through rehearsals I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> was like I think we have a good show but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not sure I think as well it was it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> was tough for us because you know we do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff in front of a camera right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and doing stuff in front of the camera </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this or like the videos that we do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> personally is very different to putting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on a show on stage right and you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> some people will be like oh but you guys </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are used to you know doing panels at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> conventions and stuff like that it's a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> very different feel yeah you know a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> panel is a million times easier than </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what what we were what we had to do on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> on stage I was [ __ ] knackered after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> everything oh yeah I I was I like it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drained me yeah so much and that and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's because like we actually try to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> make it a show rather than just make it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you know trash podcast on stage it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> really cool getting to see you guys like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the first show like the 10th show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much you guys quickly improved yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> being on stage it was really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sick yeah it was awesome yeah I I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> by like the like halfway point we all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had like a rhythm and yeah yeah we knew </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> how to like bounce off each other what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worked well with the crowd but didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> work so well with the crowds I also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> noticed we had like just without even </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> discussing it necessarily we had like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> certain jokes that we knew the kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Rhythm too yeah and like where to place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it and like because it was always you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know you you do the the show and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you kind of noticed oh okay this joke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of hit maybe I can try it again in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the next show and then without thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like I knew exactly when say like Conor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> o'gart were going to say specific jokes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you exactly kind of the feeling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Rhythm to go with it right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know God would do like the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> piece's real thing at the beginning yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which always popped off right and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> always knew to sing can we get much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> higher you know so it was just kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like it was is this weird thing of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> started off as very much like a an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> impromptu ad-lib-filled script like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know non-scripted show yeah but then I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> feel by the end of it it kind of turned </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into like almost a scripted show in a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> weird way it was like like we had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> segments that we didn't know what was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to happen and segments that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of like scripted yeah that we kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of knew how to like transition between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> segments and stuff like that definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and play off the audience and stuff like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but like having said that you know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say that every show did have a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of like Variety in in them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and we kind of did that by Design and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was very very interesting to see how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what what the different vibe in each </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> city was we definitely learned a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about I guess like the diversity of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> crowds in the U.S I I think what I what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I enjoyed most about the shows was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually like our show was our way to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> learn about that particular area and we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> got we I learned a lot that you couldn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just get by Googling yeah what are the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> top five like uh what are the top top </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five most famous things about this one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> area right it was really really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting to see what certain states </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and cities were really passionate about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they weren't um yeah that was fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because a lot of the times it was very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> surprising yeah and you know a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the times you've got questions because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we did a q a before every show uh and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people would always ask you know did the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tour change your opinion on the US at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all and I heard you always answer yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and no yeah because yes some things did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> change but it doubled down like 10 other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things oh God yeah we kept having like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> an argument about like we were like is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> the us more diverse than they they claim </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> or is it because right oh yeah I think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> the US is more diverse than say the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to Australia I was like you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> full of [ __ ] like that's nice I I didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> say that I I said it felt like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going from uh West Coast to East Coast I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> felt like going from like say LA to New </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> York to me felt more different than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to London to Sydney I I and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still believe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> why is that offensive because it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> not even close why not Australians are a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> different breed of people yeah they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like I don't think so I don't think so I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would understand the comparison between </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> say like Australia and New Zealand uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that that's a little more understandable </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but like Australia and England vote are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different we're different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I think culturally culturally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah you know I think Australians and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Brits have a lot in common oh of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we have like a very similar sense of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> humor we have a very similar I I I agree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's comparisons there what do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think of the differences then between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the west coast and the East Coast Vibes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um I think like I think the vibe in east </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coast is like totally different from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> west coast East Coast they like talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> faster they are much more direct with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the way they like speak and I I agree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with that you know like West Coast are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like way more chilled they're a bit more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> flowery with their language and their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> words whereas you know with East Coast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of like you know they talk way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> faster and things move faster in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> east coast than the West Coast you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I I you know I because when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> went to Sydney for example when I went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to Sydney </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um I was like damn this kind of feels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like London with good weather you know I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was looking you know that changes the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game though that that's that that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything the weather is everything no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no you no I remember the exact words you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> said you were like wow you you know you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hung out in Sydney for like three days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you were like this is like the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> except if everyone was happy yeah I was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah that's like going to other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> European countries like it's like the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but different language it's like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh no no no no I I think I think I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think you know different countries in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Europe are [ __ ] totally different in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> terms of like Vibes and cultures and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything like that I was just saying I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think the UK and like UK and Australia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have a lot similar culturally I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're comparing London and Sydney which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> are two cities the UK is very diverse </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> throughout and you know you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compare Scotland to like London yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> okay I would say there's a bigger </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> difference between like Dublin and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> London you know yeah like Dublin feels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a different country than yeah okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> okay but okay London let's say England </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then let's say England because England </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me is London and then everywhere else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> London has like have you gone to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> north I I have been to the North Korea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay okay where have you got what's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most how far north yeah how far north of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Liverpool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is Liverpool not North it's Livermore is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Northern come on North but it's not it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not North North it's not Yorkshire it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not [ __ ] because I've been to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Liverpool many times bro I've been to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Grimsby once it did not feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Liverpool right I don't know I I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I I think it's hard to you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> judge cities a lot easier especially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like London and Sydney because yeah well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney was kind of built like London in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a sense yeah there are sections of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney that look very similar to Saint </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fine in London but I think if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> comparing the culture of the country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like as Australia to the England it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very different it's so different it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> night and day do you think so yeah why'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you okay what do you think what do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> think is like so different about it then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because uh Jen joining okay this is now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah now you have to ask what is a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> culture let's do this again well what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> makes up the culture constitutes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> so like are we talking just the people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are we talking because like you know if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're talking how they have their own </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> dialect essentially they talk very </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> differently they're Australia has its </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> own language yeah yeah they have you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know they have uh its own native </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> population which is totally different as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well which plays an impact they don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> play the same Sports a lot of the times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as us they've AFL and they play some of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them like cricket and rugby but you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they do play other sports yes yeah um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they have Sun that's a big one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we have good beaches that changes the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> game quite frankly okay okay what okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> here's I think animals they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely different Landscapes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can say that with a place like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> America you know you go to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Florida you have [ __ ] Gators you go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to Colorado it's in its own thing but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the thing right it's still the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's native populations in America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously as well and it depends a lot I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know it feels weird because no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> matter where you go right and no matter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> how much local differences okay they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> never quite lose that kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> american-ness that they they always have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whereas like certain traits that I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Americans often have right I think that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just never really so you always even </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> though you're in Seattle you're in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Florida it always feels like America is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that that feeling never really goes no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> matter which at least from the mainland </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've never been to Hawaii or I mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Hawaii they've been to Alaska I don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know how that feels but yeah it always </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> still feels America like it can never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> quite shake that that kind of The Vibes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that Americans have in a weird way yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm I mean I'm I'm saying I do think you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know there is some kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> american-ness in the feeling and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that but I'm saying like there is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of like I go into different parts of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> America it's like there was a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like differences there was like there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like some similarities but I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never felt like such such a dichotomy of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like different mentalities and different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ways of thinking in the same country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before like well as I was saying the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason I I brought up the UK and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Australia is that to me I it feels like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know UK are like I'm gonna say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> England okay because I'm mostly talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about England yeah English people and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Australian people feel like they're cut </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the same cloth but they just have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different starting like parameters you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know but I feel like we're we're kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cut from the same cloth I you know you a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of English people get along well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with Australians I mean we're [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same brain cell and [ __ ] like that even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> though we grew up like halfway across </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the world from each other you know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean I feel like culturally we have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the same sense of humor a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the times we kind of think it's very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> similar we have like you know we have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our different cultures that depend on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know where we are in the world and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything like that and like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wildlife and the geography and all that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff but I feel like at its core we you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know we think a lot of the same ways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas in America you go to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different stages like there is such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> big difference going from a red state to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a blue State it's like you you feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I agree with that and obviously a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of Americans will be watching this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they're like yo I don't want to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] grouped in with like Nebraska oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I don't want to be grouped in with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Florida yeah and that happens a lot so a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of Americans are always real really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel patriotic a lot of the time about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> their state or where they are yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and I agree yeah there are a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> differences but again like I said it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> still feel like you never feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've left America in a sense and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I I very much feel like I'm not in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> UK when I'm when I'm in Australia when I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was there it definitely didn't feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it at all to me right I don't know I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know I was like walking around like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sydney and I saw like pubs and I saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like chippies and like chicken shops I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was like [ __ ] I feel like I'm in London </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right now I kind of feel like I'm at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> home right now I don't know again like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> said earlier it's hard to compare cities </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because the cities more often than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not like I I you get more Australian the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more you leave a city right yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> true that's true I mean you know when I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> went outside of London for the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time you know like towards like small </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> country yeah yeah like you know Chris </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> took me to like Salisbury and like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know other places like that I'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like this is definitely not like this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like as British as I get [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gets but like you know I get yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when it comes to the cities for sure but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I don't know there's still I feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like fundamentally so much more of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a bigger difference just because of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know the the years that have passed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially and the fact that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> geographically we're so far apart but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah even like you know I I get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with like in America for example like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there is definitely more of a diversity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of like the surface level with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the people like you know and not even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about like an accent wise right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know obviously the moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone opens their mouth for the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> part you know roughly whereabouts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're from all right but like I still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like yeah it's kind of said like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're still at the end of the day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> regardless of if I was in Mississippi or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Seattle I'm like it's still it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> American they're still Americans and and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe it's because yeah and maybe it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's this like what do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> think that thing is then I don't know I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> think it says um you know I realized </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> from doing this tour and speaking to way </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> more Americans than I ever have in my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> life is that Americans are like super </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] nice and they're really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hospitable hospitable for sure yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're always really nice and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> occasionally they might just say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something or something gets brought up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you know like if for some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason politics is ever mentioned they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say something like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay yeah well we disagree on this yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well I keep my mouth shut I never ring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it up but I notice some people like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cannot like okay between like super left </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> people and super right people initially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the like if you're just talking you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cannot tell the difference between it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like with something gets said oh my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> God does it come out very fast there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like a rhythm to the conversation that I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think is very uniquely American and I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know exactly how I can describe it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I don't know if it's because I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> not American yeah I can't see it but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah everyone feels super nice super </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> welcoming and then if if for some reason </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something's ever brought up that is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> political even remotely so it flips to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the American that you see on the TV </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right you know what I mean where you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> have these these very strong opinionated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people who are very open and then you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like ah okay this is the America you see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the TV which is why in a way it kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of made me appreciate America more in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the sense that I don't think it's all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doom and gloom where because I'm on TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they make America look god-awful yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they are doing you dirty and America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't themself because they know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the that's what gets clicks yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of course um and so on on TV and from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movies and all the stuff you get the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> impression that Americans are [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> insane and just to some extent in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Florida they are yeah yeah it is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> case but like I think most people in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> America are super chill super nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really awesome to talk to just don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> bring up politics yeah ever it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> funny because we actually funnily enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we went you know everyone's just like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> how many like how many more things you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to [ __ ] on about America and we we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> found a lot don't worry about that but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we also found things we liked about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America as well yeah because I I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> liked how you always knew where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> stood with an American you know because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I grew up in I grew up in British </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> culture where everything's behind like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 layers of [ __ ] sarcasm or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something like that is someone being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> passive aggressive or not you have to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through like 10 lays to figure it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I get sent an email right a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> business email he didn't he used regards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> instead of kind regards is this is is he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like am I on it like a [ __ ] he's an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] did I do something wrong to piss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> him off or did he forget I don't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with an American you always know where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you stand you know because they'll their </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> email will start with dear [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> corrects that they just tell you exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how they're feeling you don't have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like hide behind like so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> bullshittery conversation is always nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I always had a great time you know as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much as I hate tapping uh it was great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> for getting rid of change that I didn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> want oh yeah I would just round out I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like this is awesome hold up wait this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is a scam uh yeah tipping was a joke at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> times oh yeah so it is somewhat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> convenient I understand why some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Americans are so attached to it but also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> never ever let that [ __ ] leave America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> please get that out of my country yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um uh and there's some other stuff that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was nice just people were always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Pleasant yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> um but that was the thing right it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like I don't know when it comes to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the hospital boldness of like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> average American like for sure like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think we all discovered it's like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Americans for the most part very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> welcoming you know when when they mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be welcoming and they're very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> hospitable and they want to make sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you're having the best time that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can in their country yeah right but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then at the same time I'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> is that the average American or is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> just the average trash taste fan yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know that was a part of me where I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> just like we spoke to a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of uh trash taste fans obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we had a lot of days where we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were just not doing shows yeah and also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were just talking to people normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was always a good time I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely I don't think I had any bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> experiences </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um but I'm white though so I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean yeah I had a like I had got a bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of an experience in Detroit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I mean I I was like wait so when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to the tour you had a show in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Detroit and you know I've heard I had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> heard about Detroit's reputation and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> everything like that before yes uh so I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> came out like Garnet so uh there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this like anime shop there was like one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> block away so I was like what's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> worst thing that could happen if I just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> go to this in Detroit to go to an anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> shop no no no there was just one that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like a block away from our like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh from venue from the venue and I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there's nothing we got like three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hours to kill yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um I was like well why not check it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why not check out the anime shop just to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> see what the the Detroit scene is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right we walk out and I'm with my uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with uh our producer at the time and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> walking around it's actually like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really bougie area we had like really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nice coffee shops really nice it wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as bad yeah from what I'd heard from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Detroit it sounds like yeah also yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the delicious room was quite nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it was nice the streets were clean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like damn this is not the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> image image of Detroit that I thought it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was gonna be obviously I know there are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> some areas that are obviously of course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was it was it was like a nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> boujee area and I remember talk like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> turning to my producer being like wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Detroit's not what I thought he was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to be at it at all this is like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really nice looking area this is really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bougie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um as soon as I finish the sentence I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> walk around the corner </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then there's this guy walking up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> towards us he sees me and he goes you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't belong here get out and I was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like uh is he talking to me I just I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know if he's talking to me maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just a crazy guy let's just go into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the store so we quickly like Shuffle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into like the store and as I opened the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> door I just here in the corner of my ear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm talking to you boy get out now and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like I'm just I'm just [ __ ] I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just gonna go in and just uh find solace </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> in the [ __ ] anime story I would have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> been so scary yeah [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then I was like okay there's this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there it is okay there it is not good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but that was the only time anything ever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> happened right to any of us yeah I mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I got I I definitely if there's one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thing I learned on this tour is how to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> talk to homeless people and get out of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> those situations because there were many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> times throughout the tour where you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after the show you know we were just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like be hanging outside of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bus you know just like talking and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chatting getting some fresh air and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff like that and then you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> usually it's like midnight or like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> in the morning yeah and you know because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're for the most part parked in front </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> of a venue it's like you know right on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the side stream right yeah and of course </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you know with uh most American towns </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a lot of homeless people you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know walking around at night yeah and oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my God I probably maybe con it was in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> contact with like I want to say like 50 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all together on this tour yeah homeless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people every single tour there was at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> least one or two homelessness who walk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> up to us and I used I used the diet I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was gonna say I I understand why this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has this technique now the first one in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in Minnesota dude walks up you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asking for change or whatever it was I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know he was like slurring his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> words and I just I hit him with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> sorry sorry man yeah anyway sorry he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like grumbled and was just like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> at least you're nice about it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was like oh my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my God yeah because I feel like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in terms of like americanness right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there is like an inbred skill in like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every Americanization </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we drove through Alabama once and it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just changed me man it changed like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> every American has this like ingrained </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> skill yeah to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> um to de-escalate with homeless people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes I'm I and I saw it like I remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were outside like the Texas venue and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like this this homeless guy comes up and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was me you and Aaron uh and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember do you remember the homeless </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> guy I was like yo this there was Jay-Z </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> performing here and and and and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Aaron was like a full-on conversation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with him and I'm thinking like he asked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like he asked us like for crack and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff like yeah and I was just like I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what I'm doing I'm not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> going to say [ __ ] can't now which is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> completely silent yeah we were just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> completely slowing and Aaron just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> dealt with it like a [ __ ] bro he was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> just like nah sorry bro yeah sorry yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I think a lot of the times they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get homes people get demonized too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right at the end of the day they're the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] people who you know for whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> reason would like didn't life didn't go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> their way yeah I think you know just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> showing a bit of compassion they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> appreciate that oh no of course like if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's if there's one thing I've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> learned it's like the the worst I guess </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> reaction you can get from a homeless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> person is ignoring them yeah you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because if you ignore them then that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when they get pissed off right because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if you deal with it just like calmly and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just you know candidly just being sorry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man you're a human right no human wants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> to feel ignored sorry man have a good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> night just stuff like that they're good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but like I I notice it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> very different in America versus like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the rest of the world for example </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because oh yeah in most places in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> world you do ignore you know that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's kind of like that's kind of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what you're taught to do right but in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> America it's like when you you see like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a homeless person in America they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's hard to describe they're very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> much way more active and in your face </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than compare it compared in comparison </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to like other places in the world with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like homeless people I think it's harder </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right you're harder to get by yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have a system that failed them yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah obviously one thing I think we all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> noticed is that the homelessness in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> lot of the Cities was insane yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know there's certain cities it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like whoa California this is bad yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I mean obviously because West Coast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a lot warmer all year round so a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of times people can live there yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so that makes a lot of sense but man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just you feel for them man you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the system in America the way it's built </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is not fair I I remember though uh Sarah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> our VIP manager was just blown away by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the fact that it's like wait homeless </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> people don't just talk to you in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like it's like what do they do and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like you do you barely see them yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe in like Shibu or Shinjuku you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> might see them but everywhere else dude </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're not there she's like where are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and she just couldn't believe me when I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> said like yeah homeless like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> have to deal with homeless people in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan yeah they just don't come up to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you and she just couldn't believe she's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like what what do you mean what do you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mean you don't have to deal with them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like as in the not there and I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I mean I think in Japan obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about homelessness there's a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of um obviously how you become homeless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and the systems that make you homeless </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a sense yeah are very I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> impactful on then how as a population </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe they behave or what they need to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do yeah Mary you've got to be ruthless </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get by oh yeah you know in Japan I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think there's there's more options that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you have and the the reason why I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> homelessness is hard to get out of in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan is it's so expensive to get a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place and if you don't have the correct </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> documentation it's impossible oh yeah to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get it sorted yeah and then a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> homeless people in Japan there I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's some that you see sleeping on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the street but a lot of them how much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people in Japan live in manga cafes or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> live in those hotels that are one night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're they're like 30 or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> really cheap oh they live like along the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> river under them yeah yeah a lot of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times they don't you know it's it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's an entirely different system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because of the whole the whole way that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they become homeless and and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> barriers stopping them from getting out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of homelessness are different yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I you know it's very telling of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> system and what's in place yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why in Japan it's different yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I think it's just something that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if it's like your first time in America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh because like my parents like came to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> America for the first time this year as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> well uh and it it shocked them because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> they they'd never seen this kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> this you know this kind of like system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with uh with homeless people yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> know it's it's something that every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> American knows how to deal with but if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you come outside from like come from the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outside to see what is the situation in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> America it's just like very very like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> shocking I remember the first time I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> visited America and a homeless dude </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> talked to me I was like this is where I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> die yeah I could see the [ __ ] HP </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my God I'm gonna have to fight my way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> through this situation you know it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very intimidating it is you've never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> been experienced the US yeah especially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you come from [ __ ] Japan you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's scary [ __ ] I'm sure yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> terrifying yeah it's depressing as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate seeing it online with people like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> demonize homeless people and they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like man that they're the [ __ ] worst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or it's their fault their homeless yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe sometimes that is the case but I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like just labeling them as lazy or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever is is so not helpful to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> situation and uh it's so frustrating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's it's their fault if they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> homeless just buy a home yes right stop </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> buying Starbucks laughing that [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] drives me on the wall actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> actually yeah there was one situation I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think if we were in uh Nashville uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tennessee there was a there was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> homeless dude that came up to me he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a really nice guy yeah and just like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually had like a really nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation with him and you know at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the end of it all like I I just gave him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like five bucks because I'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what you're not actually all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that crazy I actually had a great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation with you you're respectable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it whatever yeah that's fine so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah take my money but like you know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna come up to me and be rude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and [ __ ] about it then like don't expect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> change you know that's not how you do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this [ __ ] you know no I I I I saw one it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was actually in Colorado actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um you know there was there was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> homeless person uh who was asking for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money uh and you know a common response </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was obviously sorry don't have any money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on me yeah uh you know I've only got a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> card and he was [ __ ] prepared man he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> he whips out this like one-on-one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> this like you do you know the square </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like don't worry you can tip me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want I'm like yo he's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> hustling man yo yo marvelous dudes in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the 21st century holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> on his phone he's like I got PayPal I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like no [ __ ] shocked me man I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like holy [ __ ] I respect that I'm taught </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in many ways about it because I I also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you mentioned like that one of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> was nice and some of them aren't nice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah well I don't know in a weird way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like man the government should </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] help them why do I have to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> decide which one is a good Court Jester </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and which one amused me the most yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah give money out like a king giving </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it to a peasant like I'm like just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] help these people stop stop </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> doing wasting all this money on other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] but I guess they say a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people don't want to don't want to pay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and also the problem's going on so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> long now that there's no there's no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> simple solution so ingrained and yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> accept it it's just become a cycle now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> unfortunately yeah yeah I mean I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> currently the system's broken and uh I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> not well informed enough to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately not to fix it yeah God's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> stepping in guys guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here's how you deal with it well okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just give them houses it's also oh you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to preface that obviously America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> has a bad one but like the UK and Europe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is also not not great at all oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Australia has tons of homes yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for sure yeah I mean house prices are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] insane yeah all of Europe and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Australia and America right now and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's hard to change the rules when the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dudes in top have uh have benefits yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in making sure the house prices stay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> high yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like what okay so we went across </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like how many states do we go in America </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> again I'm in a cross or like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drive-through or like stopped in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Stockton yeah like 30 maybe 40 35. what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was that no not that many no maybe 30 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 30. I'd say yeah 25 to 30. yeah because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it was weird because I was like talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to Sydney I was like I think I've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to more States than you have now yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> how [ __ ] well we've probably traveled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more of the US than most people yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I I actually downloaded an app </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like you can mark off like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which states you've been to in the US </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been to exactly 25 States like 50 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> of the US yeah and I'm like that's more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> than most Americans I'm like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty cool but obviously we only spent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> a day there so it's like yeah I don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> count the ones we drove yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> think like a day is enough to get like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Vibe no I agree but not enough to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know everything about the place but no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay it was like enough for me to get a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Vibe about where I would where would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like possibly like to go back in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> future maybe yes top three places in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> US we went to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> um on this Tour on this tour okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> first place is easy for me Nashville </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Tennessee </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that would be in my top three for sure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like Nashville was super weird for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you're not from the US you no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one really like knows about it there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no some musical people are from there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you just know if some new musical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people know about it uh are from there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sorry but like no one really like talks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about Nashville but it was like one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most active and happening cities we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went to on our tour I think uh because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> there's this strip on Nashville uh and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> went it's called the strip it's called </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> The Strip it was like I think it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> their Broadway or something like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and I went there on a Tuesday at 3 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> P.M and it felt like I just walked into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a music festival there's this strip in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Nashville that is like playing that has </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> live music in every bar 24 7. that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty cool yeah it's [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> um and also like the city was like very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chill it's like in the South as well so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get like Southern Hospitality which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like one thing I discovered him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was good the chicken there was awesome </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and and and it was only one of uh four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cities that voted bone and chicken as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Superior so what isn't there to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about Nashville Tennessee [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> awesome City I like natural good chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> all right so what's number two and three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then gone number two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is it is it just on this tour just on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this tour just on the stool yeah that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you discovered okay it's it's I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know if it's gonna be a cop-out but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> already enjoyed Toronto Canada as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the only Canadians that we went to no I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> really really enjoy Toronto and I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> already like planning to go back they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> would sit here actually I like Toronto </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> too but I'm not including it on the list </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah are you know what you said on this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> talk we technically went there on this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> tour where's number it was number three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then number three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll have to think about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> well for me it's like in no particular </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> order Nashville Tennessee was sick as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] yeah uh I really like Denver </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Colorado Okay um just because like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of has like it weirdly reminded me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of Melbourne in the sense that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like especially like in Denver like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the city everything is like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's built up and it's compact but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like there's a lot of things to do in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really small vicinity like you could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> walk Denver if you wanted to and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> explore it and stuff like that it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really [ __ ] dope </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> um and then I really like Seattle I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> going to say Seattle is sick as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I I I remember going there I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> loved like I love the culture of Seattle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's kind of like it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a good mix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um it's like a good mix of like West </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Coast yeah without like but I think like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> felt like their own flavor than say San </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Fran and La yeah the we went down to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those uh like famous uh markets yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and and like I don't know about you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> guys but like it gave me like a weirdly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> European Vibe yeah yeah like in like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> weird way like it was clearly still like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> American right but like the markets </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> themselves and like kind of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> atmosphere and the vibe of just that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> little area like near the water was very </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> European I'm like this is cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I will say though I I probably wouldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> include Seattle on the list because I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> been to Seattle several times before </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because I have family there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um I really really like the city but we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> went when we went there weather was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> perfect yeah weather was perfect all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> right I've been to Seattle before and it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> was raining basically every day and it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was rain I [ __ ] despise rain okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't want the rain oh another place I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually quite enjoyed which I've been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to before but this time around I had a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> really really fun time was uh Chicago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I was gonna say so my top three in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no particular order Chicago's probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on there so it was fun I hate to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this to piss off New York people but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like New York it better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um I know that's gonna that's gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trigger so many more people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um it kind of had like all the cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> aspects of New York uh at least at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the central part yeah I didn't go to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scary part yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but the the town like the downtown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and the center of it was amazing I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> thought sick and the food was awesome </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um except people kept trying to sell me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drugs that kind of sucked oh yeah of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> course Chicago Seattle for sure yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that was [ __ ] awesome that's such a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> good time yeah Seattle there's a city is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so cool yeah and where it's laid out is </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_07> food I had awesome [ __ ] food Seattle </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> with the seafood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> had king crab so good yeah so good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> actually oh go for it and then third </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> City that's a tough one to put on I'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> say I actually really enjoyed Austin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah Austin Austin was right I I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like because I you know I it's weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> actually like I I noticed that if I like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my tier list of like American cities we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> went to a lot of like the top tier ones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> are the ones that were easier easy to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> scoot around in I noticed I noticed a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> correlation of ease of like ease of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> ability to scoot around in with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> e-scooters and my likability of that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> City I will show I really I've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there before but I really like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Minneapolis I wish we got more time </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> Shame about your Winters though as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> my God and of course it was I we had to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> be there on my [ __ ] boat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I swear to God it felt like a cod </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> zombie I felt like we were going to get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> points if I brought it up Windows like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was no one no one in Cleveland </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Ohio yeah I I've been told that Columbus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Ohio was much better and it was much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> more lively but Cleveland shocked yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah because I remember I remember when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> we woke up for our Ohio show and uh you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know sometimes we have to stop for gas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something uh in Midway from like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know driving to each City I wake up I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look out the window and I turn to one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the staff members I'm like so when are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we going to the venue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and he points to like this empty parking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> lot and he was like this is the venue we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are here now and I was just like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it was wrong it was wrong one thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we learned from this tour about America </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is that for some reason everyone is hey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> so higher for some reason uh even Ohio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> hates Ohio no one likes no one likes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Ohio yeah yeah we we had uh we had one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of the questions in our live show was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like what is the one stage you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> want to be transported or Isa guide to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh out of 23 shows 21 states voted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ohio as like the worst state in America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> including Ohio including Ohio and I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like what the [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it was only San Francisco and Portland </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they voted at number two yeah so you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> know it's not much better weird how the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> US collectively came together to hate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Ohio yeah because like I think like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone's Minds you know outside out of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> America it's like the worst state is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Florida right because you just hear </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> about it so much and it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sensationalized with like Florida man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff like that but I guess like the the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the truth the the True Villain at the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> end of it all the secret villain not the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like once you defeat Florida who's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> secret boss at the end it's Ohio baby </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> after the credits roll it's a final boss </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to fight and that's Ohio yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> so that was interesting but uh you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah after our stop in Cleveland I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like yeah you know what don't blame him </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> it's pretty bad I think I would have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoyed um Colorado more if I didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] up when I got there why what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> happened oh yeah so yeah so throughout </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> I'm like what the [ __ ] so I run in the </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> drains yeah so that it like overflowed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like things so it wouldn't overflow and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it had them but clearly they weren't </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> pulled the plug realized the plug </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't basically work like it doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> unplug you have to prop something in </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> I was like he ain't taking a bath man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bad things happen I brought in my hand I </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> been a problem that kept happening where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like because none of the Overflow things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worked yeah before they were like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't like to have bats </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> am I gross for wanting to take a bath in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> a U.S Hotel absolutely [ __ ] lutely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I just wanted to soak in it I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wanted to relax yeah and so I I I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like no I'm taking a bath and I got one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> of the hand towels and I clogged it and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> blocked the drain so I could have a bath </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just enough so the water wouldn't leave </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and then when I was done pulled it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all out had my bath successful was </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> bathtub and this was an accident waiting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to happen certainly okay hold on no I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> was about to say the cherry on top of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> this entire [ __ ] cake is just the fact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that this happened because you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> playing [ __ ] sleep </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_01> showered and I came out of this room and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the corner Aaron was just sitting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there on the couch and he's like so </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> begrudgingly getting my stuff out of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bus to go to the gym so you go to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Gold's Gym and Aaron's like what do you </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> normally do cardio then I normally do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like muscle exercises and he's like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sure whatever so I think he was like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right let's do cardio but let's do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> how I used to do it when I was prepping </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> for Crater Clash yeah okay so we're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> doing basically boxing uh yeah and this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] I knew it was going to be brutal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was like well I can't be a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean I just like I did my first one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my first few times hanging out with that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know yeah I don't like let him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down and obviously I I my cardio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exercise is definitely different from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this he wanted to do a like a 15 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> incline uh at uh like a six miles per </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hour Pace uh which isn't crazy but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty tough God if you haven't done it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you haven't been practicing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> type of workout that's tough yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we're running this for about uh I want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to say about five minutes and I'm I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> struggling and he's like all right we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can stop and I'm like [ __ ] okay good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> good he's like we'll do one more round </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after this I'm like okay [ __ ] I will do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one more round [ __ ] [ __ ] I normally do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cardio and I probably go like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll do like around like 3K nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> crazy just kind of like get the cardio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> burn a few calories right yeah get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fitness just there and then I'll go on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to wait and spend more time doing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so this is just like I'm not prepared </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we start doing the other one and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about halfway through this like five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minute incline thing I can feel my body </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being at the point where it's like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotta stop or we are going to have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> consequences yeah yeah but I'm like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no we'll keep going we'll keep going so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> keep going for some reason I can I can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> keep going even when my body's begging </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> me not to and I don't know why I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> always had this problem from a kid where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like whatever my internal limit is I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like no no it's fine and I keep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pushing myself and this might never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> matter yeah yeah this used to happen a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> lot in like races where in school if we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were doing like a big race for like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> end of year racing I would do the whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> race and right at the end I would just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> throw up yeah because I would just keep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going right yeah and this happened a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> times and I haven't done it in a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it's normally when I haven't trained </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enough yeah so I go and I do it and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel awful and so we start doing some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weights and I do one we do a whole set </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like chests it's fine but something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel a bit more rough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> come on I can keep this down I can keep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this down I'm not going to throw up I </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> had bro not stupid it just it just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> annoyed me to no ends like every time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we'd go to a chicken place what are we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having chicken tendies I'm like do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not have wings do you not have the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thighs do you not have the [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't have the legs it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's so much to a chicken and every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time it was like they were like yo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Raising Cane's God's here this is so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> much better than the other place and I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's all the [ __ ] same because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all you're really judging is the sauce </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not even judging the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quality was good it was good quality it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it's like you know I think like most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of the most of the chicken places we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went to the chicken quality was kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same so the only thing you kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the only thing you were kind of judging </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is like the sauce right the chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> quality at that at that local Tampa one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that Charlie got us was like the chicken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> itself tastes so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it was so it was like the perfect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> moistness it wasn't too much batter but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was a shitload of chicken and the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> sauce oh but I heard you like Hershey's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> chocolate is this true no oh Cindy said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you love Hershey's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> ah when did she say is or is love a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> strong word two days ago two days ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I understand why though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> fundamentally why God was so sick of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken tandies because he doesn't eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sauce </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is like what the [ __ ] what are you doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> don't even bother but like there's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this there's so much to chicken like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay here's the thing why I don't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken tendies okay or no it's not like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't like it but like I would prefer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to have other types of chicken because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you remove like one of the best part of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the chicken in my mind which is the skin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you just like you you get rid of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the skin no and there's like there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> crispiness dude the crispiness the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> crispy batter is where it's at bro oh no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the batteries </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the batter is good but the batter with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the skin Cooks well that's why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why you know when when you go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> KFC and you have like anything but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> chicken Denny's the best part is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] skin I will say uh I'm sorry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you're going wrong yeah and like there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is when when we had chicken and waffles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you guys ordered chicken breasts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with your waffles that like triggered me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to no end I I did that to trigger you on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> purpose that was like there was like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> list of like you that the only time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where these boys had a choice of which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> part of the chicken they would prefer to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have with this with their meal they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could have ordered breasts they could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have ordered Wings they could have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ordered thighs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> um and they ordered like two breasts </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to be fair I I I chose I chose a breast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and a thigh and I will say the thigh was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely better in that instance </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> chicken tend these is on another level I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the kitchen the clean how clean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> breast tastes yeah compared thigh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um [ __ ] there was something else I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> forgot I'm an idiot um something sauce </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sauce thing about the sauces [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> forgot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what you know what I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> America unequivly does better than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anywhere else what chicken wings </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> straight up chicken wings are like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ginormous yeah they're they're right I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know how the [ __ ] they get clearly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something is going wrong the chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wings are like that in the U.S but I I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> not complaining because they're huge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're [ __ ] those chickens there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> so much meat on the chicken wing it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> insane they're on their creator Clash </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> diet it's insane I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> disagree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where do you think does chicken wings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> better than us uh Korea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> to me like to me like wouldn't that just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> be the sorcer yeah sorry wouldn't that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> just be the source no no no no it's it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> not the sauce right it's like they like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the Yum Yum Chicken it's it's like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know it can be a uh mixture between like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the meat to skin ratio the meat so like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a batter ratio you know I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the chicken wings in uh America there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like too much meat that it [ __ ] up with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the ratio of like the marinade right oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> God I'm I'm I I love I love Korean fried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wings so much but God damn do those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> American Wings go hard like they go so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much harder I I'd say like what I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> America does better than anywhere else </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the world is barbecue I was like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will give American barbecue as the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> barbecue in the world I think America </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> does the best part I mean this I really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> want to try like uh Caribbean barbecue </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and that kind of that kind of area yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because I know that they are well you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know I had like that uh the Cuban </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> barbecue oh it wasn't really barbecue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was like kind of barbecue-esque </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Cuban food in um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like the Cuban restaurant we went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to in Miami that was just like nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but meat and that's pretty good that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place was that place was pretty crazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I wouldn't say it's Bobby but it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like barbecue-esque in terms of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's that no bro South Korea has good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Wings they have they have the I'm sure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> North Korea has good wings too if they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have any there's definitely no meat on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> those bones though </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I said that but what are you talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> about don't get me wrong you've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> America you've been in America no you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like more better more food equals better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I order from I obviously it's in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but a lot of these like a lot of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> are like Korean chains that are in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I ordered a bunch dude they're just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> too flimsy bro there's no there's no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> meat on the bone it's just all skin I I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think the one thing I like about a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> of like American chicken wing is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a lot of the places at least the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ones where you went and it's not Fried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Chicken it's not fried chicken for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> starters but like the source is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> separate to the wing right so you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like dip as much more as little sauce as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you want whereas the Yum Yum Ranch but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like the Yum Yum she doesn't like souls </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for example in South Korea it depends on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the sauce </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> okay okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why I don't belong in America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Midwestern girl how could you not like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wrench is it even possible to not like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Ranch but I'm just like is there more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sauce than just Ranch because I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't need anything you don't need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to be I'm I'm not saying there's so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more variety in like other countries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's all about one [ __ ] sauce okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> let's go let's go through it all then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> honey mustard yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yes okay what else what what other </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> condiments can you eat with a chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wing what other condiments can you eat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> with a chicken wing oh you don't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> barbecue I actually do I mean I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally just said American barbecue I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> think barbecue works better with like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> beef and pork rather than chicken uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I said I prefer like there's uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a lot of like Thai chicken wings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well with like this very it's a very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> sour spicy sauce right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um I like the Korean chicken wings as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well with like a little bit of sweet I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like spicy stuff buffalo sauce I do love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> buffaloes buffalo wings are the goat I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] that's that's the best I just don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> want to drench it too much yeah that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> what I don't like about buffalo sauce </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like when it's sometimes it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> too I go too hot I don't get it because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you drench it in the sauce in the ranch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anyway what's the difference the ranch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you need to drench it the rent there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because Ranch is great because rice is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing I could drink less it's so good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> sauce you can eat the buffalo sauce and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you want to mix it up you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> dip it in some ranch yeah you can do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Buffalo and Ranch mixture bomb Oh I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like I'm like so what I'm so what I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> understanding here what I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> understanding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is that you guys just really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like Ranch no but the wings are amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the wings are even without the wrench </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are way better than anything yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> get like because I'm actually eating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> meat yeah whereas like in I disagree </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> where is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I said I said I think there is like I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> got what was like the biggest wins you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> want in America because I'm I'm thinking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about the wings I get in the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Midwest and in in the midwest they are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] obese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they're huge These Wings Are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> massive yeah that's why it's good I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think I'm like I'm like I I there is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like to me like well you guys you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eat chicken breasts right so okay I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just I'm just gonna realize like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] love the white meat you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you [ __ ] love that [ __ ] that's what I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> love chicken I like a mixture between </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know the the skin as well I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a mixture between having the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> marinade on it it's not always about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fried sometimes you grill it as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that's why I love like the massive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken wings though because there's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> much meat on one chicken wing with one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chicken wing you can like mix and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> matches around being like all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first bite gonna put some ranchers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just so good dude because okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> do you do you dip your chicken Wings in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the source sometimes sometimes yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because to me chicken wings chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> wings are like you know you've chickened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah pre-marinated chicken you dip in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the sauce is [ __ ] chicken tendies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's nugs not because there's no bugs no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> there's no bones right I you know the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> reason I like Bones the one with the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> bone yeah the one with the bone like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drumsticks you can dip it in the sauce </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh you're talking about are you talking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> about drumsticks I've thought you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about wings easy wings as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you get a wings as well yeah but like if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't get it in the container then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you get the container like pour it on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> top just like your [ __ ] fight into it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just like and it's good [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not I thought that was like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one advantage of having boneless chicken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is that you can just it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah why do you think we love boneless </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> chicken because of the convenience I can </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> eat everything but if the wing is there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> then I'm gonna be like well if there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> only Wings here then I'm obviously gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eat it because I like wings as well but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a little bit inconvenient for me to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have to grab the sauce and pour it on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> top that's it and I'm just like the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] advantage of wings is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> normally it's early candies I can just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> get straight into that [ __ ] it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> perfectly shaped to fit the container </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> normally the advantage of wings is that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it just tastes good by itself it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> already marinated or it's already got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> sauce you don't have to dip it in yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it sometimes with it with and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> without it's just a different flavor you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> want to mix it up yeah you want to mix </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it up it's clam take on it what I'm what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like discovering right now is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these two just doesn't they don't care </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about the taste of the chicken it's all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about the taste of the sauce you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's what do you mean no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> eats chicken wings with no sauce or dry </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> rub or anything that's psychotic are you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Dr you there's dry rubs yeah no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not and you know literally the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] Wings we had in the office from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that male in cook they were dry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> rubs no I know I like that yeah I'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> arguing against them sometimes you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> to put more sauce on it yeah why is it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> so hard to comprehend sometimes I wanna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I I like the option of additional shoes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> if I want extra sauce or not sometimes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know I'm in the mood where I'm like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't need the extra sauce because it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> already tastes good enough sometimes I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> want a little more yeah but like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm what I'm trying to say is what I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think good wings are well I think good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken is is that it should taste good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you know by itself if you are putting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> too much sauce in it then you're not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really judging the chicken you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> judging the sauce which is like which is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like my biggest pet peeve with a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like chicken places </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because the chicken wing sucks no amount </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of sauce is Gonna Save it yeah I'm not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna eat it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think we like the taste of the chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> we just like it also it yeah we enhanced </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I like I already like the taste of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the chicken but with the sauce it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an added bonus yeah yeah but if the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chicken wing sucks no amount of ranch is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> going to save that [ __ ] ah you I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know man with the amount of ranch I see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Americans put on their chicken wings I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it just seems like putting a [ __ ] ton of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ranch is not a choice it's the default </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> unless that's one and you know what I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> glad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what I saw right it's it's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> even about how good the wings are it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about how much sauce you put on it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just looking multiple times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> throughout the tour where all I had to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> say was Ranch and I got an entire crowd </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> chant everyone loves Ranch everyone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> loves Ranch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thankfully you're the minority question </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is boys what's the tour of success oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> massive success I mean a better question </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Robert is would we do it again yeah I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> think a lot of people you know in Europe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and Southeast Asia would want a tour and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh they were very vocal about how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> annoyed they were they didn't get it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and they were like I don't care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> about the tool I don't see anything </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about it the amount of Europe tour wins </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah southeast Asia we're definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> considering stuff like that because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> first one went so well yeah I think yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean I think uh I don't know if this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> can be a spoiler but we we recorded some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the shows and we're gonna we're gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put some of them on YouTube uh but I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think even after that one thing I liked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about the tour was that we got to learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about each place we went to and there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many more places and so many more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shows I want to do in different places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like learn about what goes on in that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place the culture of that place and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think if we were to do another tour we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably would not do exactly the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> format or exactly the same show but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll we would probably take aspects of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this show and try to do it you know in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> more worldwide uh worldwide more places </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> worldwide I think one thing as well that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> again like you know was a great thing to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> come out of doing this tour is the fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we've learned so much about how to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put on a performance in a stage setting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah which I think is really valuable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh you know it's you know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> personally learned a lot of skills doing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> shows on stage that you know I can </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> utilize on trash test recordings or like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know just regular videos and stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like that right and it's like it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a cool and also you know like it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just a cool thing to be like yeah I went </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> around America doing shows and [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that on stage it was pretty dope yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's just like a cool story and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> experience and you know like from the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> amount of stories we've already told </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just from this episode it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> invaluable yeah I I will say if we do a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> show again we'll probably do less shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 23 was too much 23 was too much too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I got back and like I haven't like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> streams haven't even tweeted because I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was just like I need a period in my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I just don't have an audience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching me I was like I just I just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> don't need an audience right now and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just like chilling out just doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's because 23 shows is way too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also I think I was like the only one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that actually got ill on the tour as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> well I got sick twice oh okay I got sick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> once right before we started and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh no please </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> towards the end yeah it's like I think I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had to like perform like the last few </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shows with like a pretty bad fever which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was difficult but hopefully I I got told </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that no one really noticed it no no you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> hit it very well yeah but that's because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I was literally in like I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> literally in Sage Mode the entire day I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't see any of these boys I was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like by myself on the bus conserving </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> energy for this two-hour show because I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> was like dying in bed it was in monk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> mode yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like Gathering energy I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can do with this gun you can do this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> um so yeah 23 shows is a lot uh probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to do less shows but I I I would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely want to do more shows yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> hell yeah for sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I enjoyed it it was just too long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah but the last Slide the past </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like last week we week and a half two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weeks I was kind of like all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everybody ready to go home now yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> think about Japan okay yeah I missed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Japan yeah I think though I think I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just glad that like you know I because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> again this was our first tour ride so I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think we all three of us weren't really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> too sure if we were gonna bro I did not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know what I actually experience it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing you know just we'd heard from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other people about like how tours went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's like you know not every tour is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the same kind of thing right so you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was just hoping I'm like please </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just want to come out of this tour </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> liking what I went through yeah luckily </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I did so I think it was like awesome </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like you know I think a lot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> YouTubers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and streamers whatever they often get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> in the Trap of like never leaving their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> house and you're just making stuff in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your home and I feel like you're selling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of really cool life experiences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that could enhance maybe even your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> content or how you view the world well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for sure and allow you to learn and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expand your horizons you know I think I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think traveling is one of the best ways </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just kind of open your mindset a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and learn from other cultures yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I think it's uh if you get the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> opportunity to do it you should always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do it I genuinely learn a lot about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> American history yeah I did I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know a lot more intricacies of the US </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> now yeah and how States view each other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and how they interact and how States </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well they're proud about what they what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they love talking about yeah um and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think I speak for all of us when I say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this um that you know we're really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> grateful to everyone who took like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> gamble on us essentially because we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't we'd never taught before there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was absolutely no reason that this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be good there was nothing to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell value that it was going to be a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good show yeah you know and a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people spent a lot of money spent a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of time they were driving you know four </SPEAKER_00>
