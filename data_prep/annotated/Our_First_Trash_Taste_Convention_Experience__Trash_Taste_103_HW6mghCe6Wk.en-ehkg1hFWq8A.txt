<SPEAKER_03> - How do we podcast again? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It feels so weird doing
this somewhere else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just, I don't feel comfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (gentle music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey, guys, welcome
to another Trash Taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episode.
(Connor burps) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, sorry. Can you do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Startin' things off good, I see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry, sorry, I had to burp. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you couldn't tell, we're
in a different location. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> In fact, we're on the road right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're in the beautiful city of London. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought you were gonna say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the beautiful city of England. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the beautiful city
of the United Kingdom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - England is my city.
- England is my city. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - England is my city.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And no, I'm not from Compton. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hopefully, it looks good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So, we brought our cameras.
We are using different mics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So hopefully, it won't be too different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a Trash Taste experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it should be like this for
like two or three episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if you like the old setup,
or you like a different setup, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we'll mix it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We'll mix it up, so don't worry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're gonna have a few weeks here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're gonna film a few episodes here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then we're gonna change places again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause we are on the road right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is a very like
gorilla kind of setup. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We kind of brought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all of our equipment from-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is Janken's behind fault </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> behind this camera there.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, I walked in
this room, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "This is like making me feel nostalgic." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like the old studio. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like the old studio. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's like the trip hazards are back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like there's wires everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But hopefully, we're making it work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But hey, welcome back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is, I guess, the proper
like start to season three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of Trash Taste now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, season three.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And by the time we were recording this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we had just finished MCM London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, which I think by
the time of releasing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> won't be too far after we went there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about two weeks, I think.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it? Is that how- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> round about two weeks.
- Oh, I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God.
- Yeah, it would be two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, "Where the fuck are we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in my Trash Taste time?"
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have no idea. I have no idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, it was my first MCM London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Actually, this is only
my second time in London, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just in general.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, MCM is a, I dunno
what it stands for, but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's Comic Con, basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's Comic Con. It's London Comic Con. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the biggest UK convention.
- Massive Comic Con, mate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Massive Comic, mate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Massive Comic, mate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Massive Comic meetup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like an A1. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone has A1 comics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> No, but I mean, yeah, it's
good to be back there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We haven't gone in like three years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, this is my first
convention since 2019 AX. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it is for all of us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, me too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that was the last
convention we all went to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I believe the last Comic Con, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the last MCM I went to,
was probably 2018, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, maybe even 2017 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I went to MomoCon
like one of the few years, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was the same weekend as MCM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's been a very, very long time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since I've been to MCM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, regardless, it was
a very different experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this time.
- Yeah, not only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was our first con in three years, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was also our first
con as "Trash Taste," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so we had no idea what to expect, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and (laughs) a lot of shit happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's for sure.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it kind of put
things into perspective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just one, like how long it's been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since Trash Taste has started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And two, how long it's been
since the world has moved on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since Trash Taste has started. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I remember like, this is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not anything to do with MCM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember like we met Kevin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I met Kevin and his partner. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kevin Penkin, by the way. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Kevin Penkin, sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I should have (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is just Kevin, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just Kevin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know Kevin.
- Our mate, Kevin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know the Kevin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's only one Kevin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the world.
- Garnt's the worst at this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt just throws names out
that mean nothing to people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we met our friend, Bob. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you know Bob.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt either don't say anyone's
name or just fully explain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sorry, you met Kevin Penkin
who has flown over here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the UK as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember the first thing
his partner says to me is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, congratulations on
everything, by the way." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Well, what
are you talking about?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she's just like, "You
guys have been killing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like so proud of you guys." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like,
- Aw. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Wait, I haven't met you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since before Trash Taste started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's so fuckin' surreal to me, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I feel like the
last time I met Kevin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like a year or two ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, "Wait,
the last time I met Kevin, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Trash Taste didn't exist." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was nothing.
- It feels like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we started it two months ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but in reality, it's been
too whole freakin' years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that two years though,
it's just gone like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and now like meeting people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like meeting friends
who I count as like really, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really close friends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and them congratulating me
for starting Trash Taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like so fuckin' weird.
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Startin' to congrats
on starting Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what are we, like episode
five or something? (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, you guys got a long
way to go to go still." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Meanwhile, we had just released
100 episodes this year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It makes you realized how
isolated you are in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause like, you know,
- Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - we don't get to speak much
English outside of our crew. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's so like, you
know, it's like 10 of us, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then, no one else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But then obviously here
it's like, "Oh, your friends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or there's, "Oh, their
friend knows Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's like our friends don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outside of our group here,
no one knows Trash Taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they don't fuckin'
watch English podcasts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Suffering with success, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that what we're titling this episode? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably, yeah.
- Yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Suffering from success.
- Fuckin' DJ comics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Oh God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Suffering from DJ comics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but it was a first MCM for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd only heard of MCM
from these guys mostly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, it's like, what, the
biggest con in the UK, probably? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Definitely.
- Probably by far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's definitely the biggest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's definitely the biggest.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not the biggest con-
- MCM London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - in Europe, though, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no.
- No, that's Japan Con, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I believe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, AnimeJapan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, isn't it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's Games Con,
isn't it, in Germany? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I was talking
about anime conventions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's see whose
bullshit is the best here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it might be... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I heard there's an anime- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Sound bite] Your fingerprint. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know there's a Japan expo
in Paris that's gigantic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - AnimeJapan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - AnimeJapan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like that.
- I thought it was Japan Expo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Something with like-
- Is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's got the fuckin' rotary
of like Anime Expo/Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like mix and match, bro.
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's one of them. I don't
know which one it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are we all talking
about the same convention? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're all talking-
- I don't fuckin' know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - about the same convention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because we don't remember
what it's for. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Japan Expo, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think now that you said
Japan Expo, it makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's huge, but I don't
know anyone who's gone to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I mean, that's 'cause
British people, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're like, "France? Oh, God." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then there's Games Con in Germany, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is also huge.
- I've been to Games Con. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Games Con is massive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I remember I went to
Games Con, and like I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, man, I kinda..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is when the Switch
was about to come out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I remember that Nintendo had a booth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to play Super Mario Odyssey
for like 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the line was like eight hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was a Japanese woman
just standing outside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with like a thing that said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, the wait time is like
600 minutes," or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "What?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And people were like
joining in this queue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "You know, the thing
closes before this is done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you want?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is this math? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, Games Con is like so big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that also I feel like you
can't really do anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it gets to a point
where it's almost, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like this has reached a capacity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where I can no longer do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I played like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The only games you could actually get on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a reasonable amount of time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were like the games that were destined </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to fuckin' fail the moment they came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The games that nobody gave a fuck about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it kinda like E3 in a sense? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's E3, but for Europe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's open to the public, I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all days by one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was just like, it was insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really wanna go back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think if I were to go back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it would be under like a
press pass or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where you can just be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "See, you losers, I'm going in line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna go to the front." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just cut the entire line, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm hype for like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was hype for Super Mario Odyssey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm not waiting over an hour hype, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like an hour was putting
my personal limit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I'm like
anything is worth me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting an hour in terms
of like games for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't think of a single
game where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yo, okay, two-hour line, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> two-hour wait time for like a
five-minute demo or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yo, let's go! Let's go!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the longest I ever waited </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was like an hour and a half, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hour and 40, at TGS to play Persona 5. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. Was it worth it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - An hour and 40. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, yeah, but you
know how long that game is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So five minutes is not a lot of time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you know, like-
- Yeah, exactly. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't do anything.
- you can't get into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't sink your teeth
into it, what's the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
- Not at all, not at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like you're just teasing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's like, I knew I
was gonna buy it anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was just like, at the
end of the hour and 40, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I got to the front of the line, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "Wow, that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (motorcycle revving) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bike? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Definitely not as quite as our studio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I was waiting for
like an hour and 30, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an hour and 40 minutes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I got to the front
of line, and I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Wow, I don't know if this
was even worth it or not." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing)
- Oh bro, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I actually, a
play game I played at Games Con </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was like no line for? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This is before Cuphead came out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like so fuckin'
hyped to play Cuphead, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was only like a 10-minute wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh, really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that's awesome.
- And I played Cuphead, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "Fuck
ya, this game is awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't wait to buy it."
- Hell ya. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was good. It was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, so we went to MCM.
We were there for three days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, I mean, Connor and I
were there for three days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor and I went there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on a Saturday.
- I was there for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (clears throat) one day just
because I had some things to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in and out here and there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so I only wanted to commit to one day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, how was your first
UK con experience, Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, we'll get into details later, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was lot of ups and a
lot of downs, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was very much a roller coaster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean like I expected British
fans to be super chill, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were for the most part, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but of course, you know, at
the same time, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is our first con </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as Trash Taste, right?
- Trash Taste, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's like, I knew that
my fans, The Anime Man fans, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like British fans, would be
like chill as they usually are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you blaming Trash Taste for this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing)
What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean like, could you say
that it was like 100% chill? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was, for the most part, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 100% chill.
- It was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, so here's the thing,
it was like 99.9% chill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But then, there were like
those one or two people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that obviously really, really stood out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and some of them even made waves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You might have even seen some clips online </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about some of the people
we've had to deal with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over the weekend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the intensity was just like
way more intense than anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've ever experienced
in my life before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like the same, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Me and Joey, we walked around on... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was a three-day con,
Friday, Saturday, Sunday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they have this odd ticket system </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I've never seen any other con, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like every single day
they have a priority ticket, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which means you can come in from nine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then a general ticket, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> which means you can come
in from, I think, 11 or 12, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something like that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was really
confused about that system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't quite get
it. It's just cheaper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really understand it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But we walked around on
like Friday at 10:00 AM </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before everyone got in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, we could walk
around, it's pretty chill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We got stopped a lot.
- We got stopped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, we got stopped every now and then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like, we could
still walk, like we went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get around.
- But like, you went Friday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 10:00 AM, which is literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the deadest time-
- the deadest time, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - of the entire week.
- Yeah. (chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not gonna get a deader time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> than that time.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So at least I got to
actually like walk around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even for a little bit to actually
see what the con was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all the other places, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's freaking massive, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really big. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like 20 warehouses
attached to each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, yeah, that was cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But then, once the
actual general admission </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started to come in around like 11, 12 ish, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it got very heated very quickly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It got very packed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, what was your guys' expectation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going into this convention? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was expecting like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, obviously more people
are gonna know us now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not just for individual
stuff, but for Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If anything, there's
probably gonna be more people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who know us for Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I wasn't expecting it
to be like 10 times as much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I mean, I had some expectations, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously I expected to be more recognized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything like that, now
that I've shown my face more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got an extra channel now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you just talk shit
with the boys, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But this was definitely like
an eye-opening weekend for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we've speculated before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about what an anime convention
is going to be like now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> since Trash Taste has started. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think this weekend
has definitely cemented </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that anime conventions will
never be the same again for us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, it was like
a bittersweet realization </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I remember we were all... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was a Saturday when we
all realized this, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was right after our panel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we had our first Trash
Taste panel ever, ever! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And for the most part,
I thought it was good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then there was some
really, really standout things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's hard to forget </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about our first Trash Taste experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So if you've been living under a rock, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's probably about
30 different perspectives </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of some dude running up onto the stage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and 30 different perspectives of me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> shitting my pants on stage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, we weren't really like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We didn't really prepare
anything. That's kind of on us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like we could have prepared
something, we didn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Just like, we were gonna do a Q&A. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were just, "We'll just do-" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, just keep it simple,
like how we've always done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause we we've always done panels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's just, "Okay, Q&A, easy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We don't need to think too much about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> people are normally chill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a Q&A, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "How rout up can
fans get most of the times?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I mean, the thing is with the Q&A, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's completely made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> by how good are the questions people ask. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think it's just like
roll of the dice sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that some people just ask questions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that were either just like
cringy or would ask questions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that didn't really actually
make us talk about anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just kinda like,
"What's your favorite anime?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, "All right,
is this okay or maybe not?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was kind like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there was also like a lot of
like very loaded questions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like, everyone
knew the answer to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before it was asked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, "Why
would you ask a question </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that everyone already
knows the answer to?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I'd say, for the most
part, we had good questions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was some good ones? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think like, okay,
I'm gonna say this now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna say this now, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> If you ask Connor about his
relationship status, just stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'll cringe, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is cringe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna call out 'cause like
when we see it on comments, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've read it, it's like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor's commented on it in the past. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like now, as a mate seeing
it in real life on stage, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "Come on, guys." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's cringe, stop it.
- Come on, please don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> please don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thanks, boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thanks, boys. Thanks, boys.
- I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't hold me back!
(Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got this! I got you! (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a question that
people always wanna know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they're fuckin'-
- Like I understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the curiosity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, people wanna know, and I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My thing is like, alright,
if one person asks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll make some joke and tell you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, funny, haha, I'm dating Chris." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, it was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, then someone else
just asked again afterwards. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, it's like, "All
right, he just asked that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you didn't get an answer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're not gonna get a fuckin'... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not gonna tell you anything." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Don't ask me this shit!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like, "Oh, we
didn't get a full answer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What if I ask again?"
(Garnt and Joey chuckle) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, whether I did or didn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or I'm married with four kids, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll talk about it if
I wanna talk about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's frustrating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If someone wants to
keep something private, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then let them keep their privacy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's not me confirming
or denying anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so shut the fuck up for
actually speculating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're gonna be like, "Psychoanalyze, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> breakdown word for word."
- Enhance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Enhance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, 'cause it's
parasocial andy's, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how
(chuckling) to say it, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, it sucks, but I
know it's like a part of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess it was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've seen the comments and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm sure you get it on
your Twitch chat all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hearing it in person, like as a mate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, I felt my bro, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt my bro.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I would feel uncomfortable
if like I was asked that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that involves me and Syndey.
- It's happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so many times now where it's kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, I just have the
routine of dealing with it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of like, "Haha, dating Chris."
- But that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the one thing I like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's another one that
I've kind of figured out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like going to this
convention, doing the panel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is that like it... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because we've talked about
parasocial relationships </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so many freakin' times on
the show, and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd think that after the amount of times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we've talked about it,
people start to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, yeah I get the
boys' perspectives on it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But there's also the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where if you talk about
parasocial relationships, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it makes it seem like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, the person listening is
in a parasocial relationship </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they're listening, they're hearing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, but it doesn't
always like translate well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also I understand
how like on the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes people get in weird
moods and some things happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I get it. You're
like, "Yeah, yeah." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will say that it was, like I said, 99, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I met like a lot of people there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the people I can
respect was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Look, I know 'cause you've
talked about it plenty of times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know you more than you know me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just wanna say, I get that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I still love your stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I still respect everything you've done." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that was like just a genuine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay I met like a few people
at the bar, at the hotel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who I just had just had a
genuine conversation with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like that starting
point, where, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We acknowledge this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I still wanna get to know this person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we're in a environment
where I can get to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a more chilled conversation about it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then, you do just get
these one or two maybe fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who just don't watch Trash
Taste as often as other people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause especially like
reading the subreddit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and reading how much people
have called this out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "That's fuckin' great."
(clapping hands) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Unfortunately, not everyone of our viewers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is on the subreddit, for example. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not every viewer watches every episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So you will get that casual viewer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who just doesn't know more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like doesn't know about the boundaries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as much as like other viewers, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, to me it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this is just all a learning experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like this is no way made me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not wanna go to cons or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt and Joey] No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like we've said this a
million times, but yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone was super fuckin' nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The signings were great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone was really respectful, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> except you got shot by a Nerf
gun by someone. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that wasn't cool.
I wasn't there to see, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, it was 'cause it's like open, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was open. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, we had like a table,
and there was three of us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was in the middle, Joey was on the end, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's Garnt on this end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And this end is completely open, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so anyone could have walked up
and thrown anything at Garnt, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is just an oversight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> They should have had someone
there who is stopping this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it was like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a learning experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not just for us, but
for the convention itself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for the convention as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, I remember the
conversation where we talked about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we don't know if we need security </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for future conventions yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This taught us that we definitely do need- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, we
definitely do. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We definitely do need security. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that was like a very
much a big eye opener for us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, obviously we
had the incident happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where someone came on the
stage, who apparently... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, so this is the whole fuckin' thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You said it was a learning
experience with the convention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they should know that
it would've been better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And to be fair, they stepped it up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I feel like it should
have been there anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We practically had no security really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like the first two days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think they definitely
should have had security </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the panel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I talked to some people
afterwards, who working there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and they said, "This has
never happened before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This has never even
become close to happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There was never like a precedence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of this like ever happening at MCM." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was also, it wasn't oversight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but also, like a lot of
people just didn't expect it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it just never happened before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, yeah, I agree, and
I don't wanna go too hard, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause obviously, like we
wanna go to cons again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like it blows my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that you would have a main stage event </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and not have like at least
one scary dude in the front, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like it was anyone
could have come up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone could have come up. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's still like MCM
haven't had insanely large guests </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the past. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm thinking like, "What do they do-" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, they had like Tom Hiddleston. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and it's like
there's no way Tom Hiddleston </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could do a panel on stage, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there wouldn't be a single
fuckin' bodyguard anywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno, maybe it's just
like a thing of they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, well we have
some guests this year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> None of them are super high profile. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess we can scale it
back, save some money." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But obviously, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also, a lot of these cons,
they know YouTubers are big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They know it, but they don't like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't know it, right? (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They understand, "Oh,
yes, 3 million subs," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, but we have the guy who voices </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in 'The Fairly Oddparents,' here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I know what that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know who this Trash guy is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's these rubbish rubbish boys?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The rubbish lads. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, who's these rubbish lads? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing)
What are they? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So there's this complete... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a lot of cons do have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this kind of disconnect between like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because a lot of the
cons are ran by people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who understand older media
and traditional media, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't really understand
YouTubers that well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They should buy now, but they don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I feel like
there's a lot of oversight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that happened there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then getting to
this guy in particular, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who came on the stage,
which was a weird thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause this guy didn't do
anything for the first 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then started shouting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone thought he
was like just a heckler. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought he was a heckler, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "We've all dealt with
hecklers in the past as well." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, someone asked a question, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I just like heard
someone shouting something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like the fuckin'
background and something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "Oh, okay, it's-" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, just ignore 'em. It's whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Passionate anime fans, I've
heard it all before, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then suddenly I see some guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just walking up to the
stage, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Is this happening?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is this happening? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I heard like a guy go,
"No, no I'm coming on." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like, "What?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, someone stood
up, and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What the fuck? Someone's coming up." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like, "Oh no worries, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> security will deal with it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was like,
"There'll be someone there." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, "Okay,
he'll get to the stage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh no, he's on the stage.
Well, he'll get near the sofa. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh no, he's near the sofa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, oh, he's sitting next to Joey." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I remember just like just waiting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because I assumed that
there would be someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who would've come on and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like someone's
coming from backstage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He's gonna come and collect him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, "Backstage?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I was like, "No, no one on the sides. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Um, what did we do?"
- And a good like 30, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 40 seconds passed where nothing happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even the crowd was
like, "Is this a bit?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "What's happening?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was so like out of left field </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I talked to some
people, and originally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they thought that it
was just a special guest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that had come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A special guest. (chuckles)
(Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A special guest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just a random dude, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, just a bit in like
our show or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the best way
to describe it is just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were just shell shocked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it was definitely
traumatizing, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause that's like, yeah, as
I said, it was unprecedented. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that's never happened at any, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> probably never any of our panels, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt and Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, so it's just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno how calm we looked on camera, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm pretty sure
internally, we were freaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the fuck out.
- Oh, I was shitting myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I was like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> This dude like sat right next to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like he kinda like shoved me
outta the way 'cause I sitting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of in the middle
of the couch like this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he like shoved me out of the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, he like, I mean,
everyone who was there saw it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he tried to like
grab the mic off my hand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw that.
- Yeah, 'cause he wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to say something, and I
was like, "Ah, no, dude," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, "What the fuck are you doing?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he just like starts rambling
off about something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even what the fuck.
- But he wasn't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like being coherent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, but it was just
like coming into one ear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and out the other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was just fuckin'
looking around like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Ah, is anyone gonna do
anything about this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I remember what he was
talking about was nothing to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with what the question was asked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or what we were talking about before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He was just completely out of his mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He was just rambling on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about something completely incoherent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And meanwhile, Joey is
frantically looking around, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to find- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey, (chuckles) I
felt really bad for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You were like, "Anyone? Anyone?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, "Help." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I didn't wanna be the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to like instigate something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I don't know, the dude
might have a knife, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The dude might suddenly
fuckin' swing at me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like, "I don't know what to do." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't like push him off or anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he was also fuckin' massive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, this guy was big. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, big guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I not saying that I would punch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if like a fuckin' two-foot
man came on the stage, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but like I'd be a lot more
lightly just to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to try and leverage
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my own position if they were- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If a child comes onto
stage, you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, baby."
- Just stand up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the drop, kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, it was just like,
you're in the situation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone comes up, and you
look at him, and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "If this guy really wanted
to swing for any of us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> odds are it's gonna fuckin'
like really fuckin' hurt. " </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I probably wouldn't
be able to punch him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like he was really tall and big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's just like, you just sit there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like weighing your odds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, "What do I need to do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's the best way to handle this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I'm processing,
processing, processing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause you rarely find yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a situation like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you don't know what
the outcome is going to be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so in your head you are just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What's the worst outcome
this could possibly be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and how could I prepare for it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you're kind of in
like fight or flight mode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at that point, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and also, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was that like side of me as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like, okay, say for example, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if I fuckin' tripped him up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as he was like trying to flee, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he like smashes his head in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's gonna Amber Heard me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like try and sue me
for defamation and damages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "I didn't want that either." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like, I literally
couldn't do anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just had to sit there and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just prayge that way
someone would help me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was just like hoping, I was, "Okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously, a lot of people were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Man, you should've just like
punched him or something," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like, "Well, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna be the one to escalate it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> At the end of the day,
we're still on stage, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we are trying- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, Creator Clash was like a month ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, dude.
(Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not what they
paid the money for, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like you're sitting there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have to like go through it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "All right, well
what does this guy want? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why is he on stage?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, initially, I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, maybe he just wants to be funny." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Well, this is great 'cause
I can handle cringe." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like half of my videos
on my channel are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try not to cringe challenges. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like I'm fine dealing with a guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to be funny on stage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll just outweighed him in cringe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I know that I can sit here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if this guy was trying
to be funny, which he wasn't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but if he was, I was like, "It's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just wait until he
feels so unbearably awkward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that he'll just leave." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I'll be like, "All right, good," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is what I think happened
eventually. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But this guy was completely, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> he was not in the right state of mind, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like this guy was clearly unwell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he was also doing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to a bunch of other panels as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he clearly wasn't
like a targeted thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was just like going around, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just wreaking as much havoc as possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So yeah, what I heard
was, I don't know how... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Again, this is not 100% confirmed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but this is the story that I was told. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Apparently he did this to another stage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - After ours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, after ours? Oh shit,
I thought it was before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was after ours.
- Oh, so, after ours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, they tried to get him removed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but at the time, they didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause for some reason they
didn't listen to the person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who was trying to get
him removed or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like a whole thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, yeah, we were told the next day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that he was arrested
afterwards, and I think charged, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what with, but apparently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they went and asked him why- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Being cringe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, why he did it. Yeah, cringe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Sentenced to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sentenced to jail for being cringe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sentenced to die of cringe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I sentence you for being cringe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what are you in for? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was cringe at a con. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno. Maybe like
trespassing or some stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't fuckin' know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Either way, I mean, glad
that something happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They caught him and
asked him why he did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He said something along
the lines of, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> he apparently just
wanted to go up on stage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like he didn't really know who we were. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> He was just there trying
to get on stage to things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was just unfortunate timing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it was a guy at our panel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> who just wanted to jump on stage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, it could have been
anyone at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're lucky it turned out well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If that guy really wanted to do something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this could be a really different story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I see it as
a positive experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it really- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you wanna be in my seat
and say that or? (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure. (laughs) Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Let me say, I see it
as an event like this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where something this big happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and nothing bad came out of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it really put things
into perspective for us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It made it guaranteed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that something like this
isn't gonna happen again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because now we are more aware of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now we're gonna convey
this to wherever we go to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think, it's obviously not
a good thing that happened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and maybe we should have
been more prepared for it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it did happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Nothing too bad came out of
it, aside from just seeing- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of cringe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor and Joey laughing)
- A lot of cringe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just like getting his ass
flashed in front of our face, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because his trousers
were like half way down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't even like a half crack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like he might as well have
not been wearing pants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like the full ass crack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Oh, God, why? Why?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Also he stank, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like he really fuckin' stank.
(Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Holy shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you definitely smell like a
con goer, that's for sure." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just fuckin' hope that
guy gets the help he needs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause he's clearly fuckin' unwell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like, I dunno,
it was just fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It sucked as well 'cause
halfway through, we had to... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> The panel, it was going
okay at that point, I'd say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we were already kind of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Fuck, dude, we gotta do this
panel now after that happened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like pretend like nothing happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - At least if it was
like near the beginning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or near the end, then it'd
be a little bit easier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to kind of just like clean
it up and get over it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was like dead set
in the middle of the panel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like the hardest
to kind of recuperating, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like get back onto the flow of things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I remember I tried
to like continue the panel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the only image that was in my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just that ass-
- That ass. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - that bare ass crack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That bare ass crack just like
hypnotized me to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Whoa, where am I right now?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me, it was that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And also, just like in the
back of my head being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "What if someone else also does this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what if like another
person is just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well, they didn't fuckin' do anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now it's my time to get
15 minutes of fame." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like so fuckin' scared for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And also, I was just like, "Oh good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna see this all over the subreddit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the Twitter feed in like
17 different fuckin' angles." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, it was whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Again, the silver lining
is that now we know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> now we're gonna be a little
more prepared for future cons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and future events and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nobody got hurt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, nobody got hurt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the important thing.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Just a lot of trauma and a lot of cringe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just a lot- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of emotional damage.
- of torture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drama by cringe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> basically.
- Yeah. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Emotional damage, but no
physical damage, so that's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aside from the panel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> how else was your guys' kind experience? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean the signing
was freakin' awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That was a good thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least like everyone
who came to the signing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was super nice, super respectful, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lots of like really cool
artists and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just like kind of wish I had enough time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go to the Artist Alley </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I feel MCMs Artist
Alley was really freakin' good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> compared to like other
cons that I've been to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like naturally
when you're at signing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of people bring up
stuff that they bought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at the Artist Alley.
- Oh, I saw some of the stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from the Artist Alley.
- Some of the stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was genuinely like, "Where
the hell did you get that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I wanna get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But unfortunately, we
didn't have enough time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to go to the Artist Alley this year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that was a little
disappointing, but, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, It was kind of hard to walk around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in general this year, I feel like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I feel like the
last convention we went to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like AX 2019, and we've said that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we could still walk around
the convention, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like we get stopped every now and again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> especially at a event like AX. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it wasn't to the point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it completely stops your movement </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like made it so you
couldn't walk around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I felt like that was very,
very different this year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like I didn't even bother trying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> especially after I heard
what Connor tried to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughing) Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I knew you were gonna fuckin' tell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughing) We've got to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We've got to.
- (laughing) It's just so- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so funny.
- It's so funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like after the panel
and after our signing... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Was it after the signing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was after the signing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so after the signing,
like our day was free, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we had like a good two, three hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to enjoy the convention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were like up in the
green room right after. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So,
we're up in the green room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And normally, at this
point, we're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Great, we've got two, three
hours to enjoy the convention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's just walk around
and stuff like that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like seeing how many
people were at our signing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and seeing how many people
couldn't even make it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to our signing because
the signing got cut off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The line was like full
capacity like an hour or two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even before we started the signing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I felt bad to everyone
who wanted the signature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Sorry.
- Yeah, really sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - We would've done it if we could've. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We would've done it if
there was enough time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but unfortunately-
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we were signing for
like two and a half hours, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that was like capping
the line two hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before the line even opened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, so I got the feeling
that probably not a good idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to walk around, especially
without security. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And Connor was just
like, "Guys, I got this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got the perfect disguise." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So let me tell you what
Connor's disguise was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, so let me tell you
what con's disguise was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a normal COVID surgical
face mask and some sunglasses. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And a hat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is genius.
- And a hat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is genius. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, first things first,
wearing sunglasses inside, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> totally inconspicuous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one's gonna look at you at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you be
wearing sunglasses inside? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was bright. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Second, that he forgot
that the shirt he was wearing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was a Trash t-shirt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That hasn't been
released yet. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a Trash t-shirt that
hasn't been shipped out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the general public yet, so. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen, I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also, it's the Trash
t-shirt that you see him wear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in almost every video
(Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and every episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like that shirt
has just been synonymous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Look, like, yep, that's Connor's shirt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanted to say hi
to some of my friends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I was like, "Hey, I'll
just come quickly and say hi." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I wasn't gonna stay out long.
I was just gonna say hi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And obviously, I knew it
wasn't a full-proof disguise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wasn't fuckin' going
to film any movie scenes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fooling anybody. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, "Maybe
it'll just buy me enough time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where people will double glance, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I can just walk away," right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt And Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I was like, "Okay, let's-" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And how far did you get? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, no, so I went to meet my friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who I told to come meet
me like at the gate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was like, I literally
walked out like two meters, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there my friend was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Problem was that at this area </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was really convenient for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people were waiting for
Sydney, signed Sydney stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And obviously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people were waiting around
there and recognized, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so people just started
coming up to you right away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I was trying to talk to my friends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was just really
fuckin' annoying. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was just like, "Hold on a second. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just talking to my
friend, give me a moment." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they were like
just asking for photos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the moment I turned
around to like go back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was like five people on this side. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And then because my friend
left, who I was talking to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people just filled the
void, and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, shit, I'm getting surrounded." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, the people in front of me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just quickly took a picture
with them, and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Make this fast, please, please." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the people behind me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could just feel them be
like, "Connor, Connor," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "I've gotta go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I gotta go. I'm so sorry." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause if I start doing
all of them, I won't- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just never ends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I won't stop, and it sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "I have to go." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, "I'm sorry that I wasn't
able to give you a picture." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is the most like suffering
from success story ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it sucks, right?
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, friends would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, come hang out, I'm over here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "I'm sorry, I can't walk there." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, "Oh wow,
okay, you're too big, huh?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Literally, yes." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, "I actually can't walk to you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> This will be a miserable
experience if I walk near you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like it's literally not even us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to like humble brag. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like the truth.
- No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was just like this
was the eye-opening weekend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for us to see like, "Oh, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> now we have to consider things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we've never had to consider before." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't get me wrong,
we're greatly appreciative. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're very grateful, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously-
Yeah, we fuckin' love it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean like 'cause after a signing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really, really wanted
to go to Sydney's panel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause her panel wasn't on the main stage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was on like one of like the side stages </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like in the
middle of the convention. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was kinda like a two
or three-minute walk, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was like a two or three-minute walk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through like this crowd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember asking one
of the handlers, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can I go see Sydney's panel?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it was our first panel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "I wanna see my girl, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where's my girl? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Where's my girl?"
- Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they were like, "I don't
think that's a good idea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You should not be walking
through that crowd." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like they literally were just like, "No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> After what has happened on
stage, we cannot stop you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we highly, highly," and
they're like begging me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Please don't go."
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I could see like the
sweat drop on their face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like being like, "Oh, if he
says yes, I can't deny him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't wanna deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with like the consequence
of it happening." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (chuckling) 'Cause actually
like, so on the second day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so on the Sunday, we were
hanging out at one of the bars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like the Novotel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like far enough
from the convention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's like not too many people there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but close enough that you could walk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to and from the convention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was hanging out there
with a few of my mates </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on like the Sunday, and it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone was still in the convention, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it was like pretty dead. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so you guys had your signings, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I wanted to meet you guys
in the green room or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so once the con ends,
your guys' signing ends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so I'm like, "Great, let's go meet up." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I said, "Oh, okay,
I'll go to the hotel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we were staying at," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which we had to go to the
other side of the convention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember going out with my mate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to see the optimal path
to walk to the hotel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we're going to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And what it felt like, I walk outside, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone started to go
outside to the big grassy area, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because the convention's over now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you just see like this massive crowd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And what it felt like is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know like in that fuckin' zombie movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they're on like
the roof of the mall? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they have to get like the food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they see like the crowd of zombies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they have to walk through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally, like the
opening scene to Dead Rising. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, (laughs) that's what it felt like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm just like, (sighs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, let me plan on my route. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's like the most
optimal route I can walk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's the least possibility
I could be stopped. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Grab the bench and start swinging. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "Outta the
way! I need to get food!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I get my baseball bat out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laughing)
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just short of
"The Dead" or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - My God, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, like a lot of things
happened this weekend, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think all in all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a positive experience, I'd say. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> - Guys, how much time do you
spend on your phone nowadays? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And what'd you guys do on your phone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just browse on the web. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The scary part is
that your phone carrier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> collects all the data on
whatever you're doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Verizon even admitted it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?!
- Oh, God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They say it's so that you
can get a better understanding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of your interests. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But really, all they wanna do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is sell your activities to advertisers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The more they can get on you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the larger the paycheck becomes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is why I use ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - ExpressVPN is the app that
prevents your phone carrier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from being able to see the sites you visit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and sell it off to third parties. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All it takes is one tap of a button, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all of your network data
gets encrypted and rerouted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through ExpressVPN secure
servers for ultimate privacy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not only does it shield your web browsing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ExpressVPN protects all
of your network data, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you can stay private even
when using your favorite apps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the best part is one
subscription can be used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for up to five devices at the same time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have my whole family using ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have a family, but if I did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would all be on ExpressVPN! </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> The link's in the description below. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was cool and weird having bodyguards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We got bodyguards on the last day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we certainly did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Obviously, what happened on Saturday, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the main panel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Garnt getting shot
by a Nerf gun and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They kind of were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, we will step this up a lot." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they went like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They gave props to MCM </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for doing it.
- Above and beyond, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We had like-
- They went above and beyond. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - (chuckles) four fuckin'
bodyguards with us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was so, I felt excessive,
but I appreciate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Had a really nice guy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, he was really
chill, who would speak to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it was really
strange going in in the toilet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just coming out of the toilet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's just like waiting for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Okay, this is
weird," but it makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, he was very professional. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I see why people don't mind having one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I thought it was
gonna be really overbearing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having someone behind you,
but he was really nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He just kind like stood back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and whenever he felt
anything was happening, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he would just kind of
introduce himself or not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He would just kinda step up a little. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, just kinda interject a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was really
good. I mean it was nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Definitely, we learned that
we have to get it now for AX, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess.
- For AX, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like future conventions
that we're going to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, like I said, this is
like our first convention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> since starting Trash
Taste, and now we know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This has like set the
presidents, precedence, for us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - President.
- President. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That word's really given
you a lot of trouble. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is, it is, it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The president, Mr. President. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Set the standard for us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is what I'm saying.
- Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I mean, I still had
a great time, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it was awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I said, everyone was super nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like getting to see people after so long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> has been like crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just reminding you
that great people exist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, just like seeing everyone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> seeing the gifts that
we've been given as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So many fuckin' talented
artists and stuff as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think my favorite gift </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was given to all of us, actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was there was this like
wooden Trash Taste plaque, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like perfectly crafted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, there was such
great craftsmanships on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Oh, this looks amazing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember gorping at it with Joey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we were just admiring
like the craftmanship. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, we turn it around, and it says, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Lick my balls."
- Lick my balls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And we're both just like, "Damn!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He got gonged. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Grant laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone gave me these cards, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I found them in my pocket earlier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And one, it just says, "Hamon,
Lord of Striking Thunder." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, those are
Yu-Gi-Oh cards, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I didn't know,
there was Hamon in Yu-Gi-Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there is, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why is there Hamon in Yu-Gi-Oh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This one is "Raviel, Lord of Phantasms." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't really understand why
that one was relevant to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think Hamon is my one, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? You're Hamon?
- I wonder why you have it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah.
- What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was given Hamon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want Hamon, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Someone just gave me a Yu-Gi-Oh card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I had it in my pocket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think they gave one for Garnt as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but it must be in the bag of stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I guess. Wow, it was cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So yeah, thank you to
everyone who showed up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and gave gifts and signing
and the panel and all that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was really, really cool. Really cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Would you guys think
about getting masks to wear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for like future conventions
and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A better disguise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> than what you have?
- No, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That was a solid disguise, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now, do you wanna talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the disguise you were
thinking of having? (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay, okay. You know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> After seeing what happened
on the second day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I call up my mates, who
was on like the floor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "Can you buy me a mask?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I wanna see if like the mask works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a full? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a full face mask.
- Like a full face mask. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, they buy me a mask. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not gonna say what it
is in case I end up using it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for future conventions, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they buy me a mask of a character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's that's all I'm going to say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so, we go to the bar afterwards, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they bring me the masks, and
I try it on in front of Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Joey, does
this mask work at all? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you tell it's me?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the first thing Joey says is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "You ain't tricking anyone." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because it's like the
mask just covers the face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because Garnt's hair stands up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just Garnt's hair above it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you can tell from... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If you are aware of what
Garnt's hair looks like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so freaking obvious. I'm
like, "Yep, that's Garnt." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, because I knew
that wasn't gonna work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because back in AX 2018, 2019,
whichever the last one was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Aki and I tried to do the same thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We didn't even have like a face mask. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We had like a full covering the head, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like balaclava-style mask. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we were both wearing that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we were like, "Yeah, we're
gonna get away with this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They'll never freaking know." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were walking from
the hotel to the convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which was like a two or three-minute walk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And as soon as I got out of
the hotel, someone was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, Joey."
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, "Fuck it! Damn it!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - My perfect disguise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, I immediately gave up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, I don't think it's gonna work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why I was laughing
also when Connor was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "They'll never know it's me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't expect it to work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "It'll just
buy me enough time." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You might as well just
had a sign that says, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "I am Connor for Trash Taste."
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like a sign that says,
- I'll do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I am not Connor." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I am not Connor.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll do that on the next show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll get a giant fuckin', </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like one of those pizza
flipping sign things? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, "I'm not Connor."
- I'll be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> an arrow here that's
like, "I am not Connor." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I actually
did try it on a Sunday, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it worked for a bit, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It worked, yeah.
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like people would
definitely recognize me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like as I was walking
around the convention, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people would definitely recognize me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it wasn't like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like Connor's trap, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well, what Connor wanted to do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which was it bought you enough time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they didn't like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You didn't get stopped immediately, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I could see like every
fifth person I walked past, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they did like the double take. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They did like the double take. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They would walk past and then
like something would click, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they just like, "Is that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who was that guy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, who was that guy? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I felt a disturbance in the
force for a second there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but like that bought me
enough time to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, they've looked around, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm already like enough the way down." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, it definitely
didn't hide my identity, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it made people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not immediately recognize me.
- Like not run up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from a distance kinda like, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think like as long as
you don't stop in one place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for too long, then it's useful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the problem with that is that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if you have that particular
mask on, for instance, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then the word is going to spread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's gonna be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, so the guy in that
mask, yeah, that's Garnt." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it just doesn't work anymore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now they're just looking
for the guy in that mask. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's like, it's a one trick pony. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You gotta get like a
new mask for every day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or every fuckin' convention
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause I did see like
a couple of people I knew, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like YouTubers and stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who were going in like
cosplay, and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Okay, that's smart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you're in a full
cosplay type of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's not just like
covering the head type of thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like in saying that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> am I bothered to get like a full </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or my full body cosplay
to like walk around? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I'm not.
- It's too hot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, it's too hot.
- Speaking of cosplay, though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my God, Genshin has like
taken over this year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like every third cosplayer
I saw was a Genshin character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause normally I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the anime con experience
is like one or two characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would completely take over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Now, it was just like the
entire cast of Genshin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there's a lot of Genshin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't realize that it was that popular. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's right, 'cause I
remember in like 2018, 2019, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the big thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least for people who
came up to my signing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like Nekopara characters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think I saw like two
Nekopara characters today, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nekopara, was that big? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, there was a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's so easy to cosplay, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I guess so.
- And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so many variations, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like it's very easy for a
lot of people to cosplay it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah, now it's just
like Genshin or Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or there's something else.
- I saw a lot of Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And there's always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna be a lot of-
- I was expecting that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> though.
- I was expecting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of JuJutsu Kaisen as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course.
- That was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the big three that I saw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's not mid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, because it's not mid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apparently.
- It's not mid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but like my mates were telling me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that like the Genshin line or
the line to buy Genshin merch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like by far like the longest line. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't even know they
were selling Genshin merch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well, this is the closest
any Genshin fan is gonna get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to buying actual feel
real merch, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But there was one part
of me that was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh man, there's so
many Genshin characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that have been cosplaying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like, "Oh yeah,
this is like a new era </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of like cosplaying at cons." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the one thing where I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh yeah, this will never change," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is people coming up to me
making me sign Death Notes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah.
- Ah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "That is
a piece of con culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that will probably never go away." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That will never go away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That will never go away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "All right,
that's familiar right there." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck, I just remembered that
happened to me as well, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I probably signed like
10 or 20 Death Notes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like during this week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, that's one
piece of like con culture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm glad will never go away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like gotten to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where I know the notebook now
when I get given it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because they make it like you
always get the Death Note, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they make you sign it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they're like, "Close the cover," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like staring at you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, they're like,
"Ha, what do you think?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, "Haha, you got me!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the pages are very noticeable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, I don't know,
you're not fooling anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even have to
like flip the cover anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to see what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "Yeah, that's death." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you superstitious about it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I know some people don't sign Death Notes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they're like, "Oh,
what if I actually do die?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? Who? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've met some people
who don't sign them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh.
- Ah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like, "Are you
wishing me to die or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's fucked up." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, I mean, like also another thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is like there's a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that try to get you in Deez
Nuts strokes nowadays as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the new like Death
Note, like trick now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like I had a couple
of people being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, can you sign this for my friend? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He couldn't be here because he had ligma." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like this close to being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, I'm sorry for your friend." (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I had to stop myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I was like, "Mmm." (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think this guy
tried it on all three of us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think I was first, and
I was like, "All right, nice." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Ligma, okay, wow." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Come on, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you really think that's
gonna fuckin' work?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> find something creative.
- Although, I must say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the dude who found
that restaurant in London, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which was called Secundus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that was genius. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "All
right, you deserve that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You deserve the grit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like a Deez Nuts stroke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that had effort put into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I respect that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he got us these like
Indian, or I think like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Indian nuts or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was like a snack
that was made outta nuts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was like, "Oh, I got
you some nuts from Secundus." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Okay, that's kind of funny." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing)
That was really funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "I'll take it. I'll take it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I respect the creativity, I'll take that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What were some of the
gifts that you guys got? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Was there anything that stood out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, there was one.
Actually, we got it yesterday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But there was this guy, this artist guy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who gave us this like poster, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's like a mecha artist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he made this like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe it's on screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe it's on screen. I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But like he made this like
Trash Taste mecha, essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and it's like full on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It looked-
- Connor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - really fuckin' good.
- you saw it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It looked freaking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like kind of a cross </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> between a Gundam and an Ava type of thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was like, it had like
the Trash Taste purple on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it looked really freaking cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was like,
- It was really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Yeah, I did it in two days." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "What the hell?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish I could do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was really nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really wanted to give it to Alan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I know he is like
a massive mecha head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so I've like held onto it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'll give it to Alan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's really cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I wanna see that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there was just like
so many cool, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really talented people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a girl gave me a ring
that she had like made as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds so cool.
- Brilliant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And yeah, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously, pieces of fan
art and stuff like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is like amazing as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, we've kept all of it obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got like a custom Pokemon card </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for mine and Sydney's wedding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like custom-made.
- Oh really? Shoot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like proper metal and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like-
- Oh, cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's pretty fuckin' cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - that was one of the
coolest gifts I've gotten. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember there was a guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who came to my signing on the Friday, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he made me sign
like Holo Yu-Gi-Oh card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, "Oh, that's really cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't seen that in a long time." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He came back on the
Sunday to give me the card </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in film like this.
- What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, I like scoured it
all over the continent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and like find it for you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he like came back on
the Sunday to give it to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was just like, "You've
achieved, bro! (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You've achieved!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Give me a limited edition
first (indistinct) please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would like one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you get someone... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you get a masterpiece? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah, the guy, I was
really disappointed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he brought out a copy of "Master Piece," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like-
- The Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the Hentai. It was
like the full doujin colored. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Oh my God." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He said, "Yeah, sign it for me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Can I have
it?" And he was like, "No." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Hey,
I gotta shoot my shot." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "Oh, you got this for me!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, just sign it bitch!"
- It was like a joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like joking with him, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like, "You got this for me, right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, "No." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "I think
you've got it for me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, this poor guy behind, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we had like, obviously, you
have like a handler at a con, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically the handler's job </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is to just kind of get you
to where you need to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and also help with the signings,
kind of help with the flow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was like this normal
British dude who just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he was talking me about
football and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I pretended like I
understood what was going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And (chuckles) I take out
this masterpiece to sign it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just open it up, and
I'm like, "Nice, nice." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, "Whoa!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whoa! And I'm like, "Oh
yeah, this is not normal." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is not a normal thing to open </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just admire right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I closed it, and
I was like, "All right." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, "Wow, that
was intense, wasn't it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuckin' wierdo, right? Wierdo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Freak! What a freak, dude! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I totally just like bought into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like my handler
who was next to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, yeah, you've signed
some pretty weird things." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "You haven't
seen anything yet." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, literally, as I
said that, some dude was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Can I get you to sign something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like very questionable?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "All right, here we go," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he pulls out like a Sasuke X Naruto, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yaoi doujin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I signed that as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And he was like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Where do
you want me to sign it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like on the cover and stuff like that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like, "No, open it up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and find the most fucked
up page to sign it on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I don't wanna open this
in front of my handler </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like, 'Oh, wonder where's
the most fucked up scene.'" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, I did find the most
up scene, and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "All right, I'll do it right there." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And she was just like, "No judging. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what? These
are your fans, I guess." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Yeah." (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember, like I had a similar
experience, because okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've talked a lot about MCM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I always say like the signing experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like the smoothest signing
experience I've ever had- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - at any convention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They had this shit on lockdown, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was like in and out,
in and out, take your stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They gave us like a post note </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like what they wanted us to sign, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what the person's name was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like excellent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was so streamlined. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was so streamlined. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember the first one,
the first SAS one that I got, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it was a manga called, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like I think like "Dick
Fight Island" or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think I remember that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know the lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was "Dick Fight
Island," and I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, what's this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he goes like, "Oh,
Sydney recommended it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "That sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Sydney recommendation."
- Of course, she did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he just goes off on like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he just starts going off
on like the entire synopsis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Of "Dick Fight Island," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is apparently just a
bunch of dudes on an island, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they fight with their dicks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's what I'm guessing is it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But he goes into it in
like such graphic detail. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, that sounds like a really,
really interesting story." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I sign it, he goes away, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we had like a little
five-minute breather. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And my handler goes to
me, "So, what do you do?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a long story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, "How do I explain this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should have just been like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yes, I'm the author
of "Dick Fight Island." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you know what, actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I got someone came out
to me who is like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like referenced, I guess, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to anyone who has watched
this episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, 2Oh man, I love your work." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he just gives me
a copy of "Goblin Slayer." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like-
- Did he actually? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, "Oh, can you sign it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Yeah, dude, let's do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I signed a "Goblin Slayer." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hell, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh God, that was interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I mean, there was
a lot of normal things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone thinks that like
they're gonna hand you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the weirdest thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I'm gonna go show you
something really out there." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, "All right,
I've signed everything." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I love how it's those
people who are always like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I'm sorry, you've never
signed anything this weird." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like (chuckles) no idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is baby mode right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, this is baby mode, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, did anything else
notable happen to you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the convention? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ah, I dunno. Did anything? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I got to see a lot of people
I haven't seen in years, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which was nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you guys get recognized anywhere, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like at a weird place that
was not in the convention? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I got... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause the hotel they put us in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was like literally like the Connor Hotel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So anyone who was going to the con </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was staying in this hotel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like I'm in the
elevator, sorry, lift. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow, you've changed. You've changed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've changed. So I
got on the lift, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's this guy, and he's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh wow, you're CDawg, right?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Yeah. Hi, what's up?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like, "Can I have a picture?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Yeah, sure,
let's do it. Let's do." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like I'm taking a
picture with this guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he's like trying
to get his phone ready, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he's like giving
stuff to his girlfriend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or whoever this is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And his girlfriend's like,
"Honey, who is this guy?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like, "You know, it's CDawg." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And she's like, "All right." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, "Yeah, I
used to watch his videos." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's such a backhanded compliment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, that's a bro moment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a bro moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he said this to her and
looked at me and just smiled, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, "Ready for the picture?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Unravel, stars playing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I used to watch his
pictures, I mean videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "What the fuck, dude?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where you just like, "What happened?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I get it, maybe
you got busier and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But could you say that little later? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Why are you gonna say it to my face? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That's kinda like saying- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you just get like L
plus ratio plus fell off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This guy was like, "I
used to watch his videos," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he just smiled at me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "What bro,
what do you mean 'used too'?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean, I guess like
one notable thing was the panel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that we had on Sunday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, how did that
go? 'Cause I wasn't there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So the Saturday panel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was kind of like a Q&A
type of thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was like, there was
a microphone in the crowd, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people could come up
and ask the questions, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we'd answered type of thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the Sunday one, it was
like the title of it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A Conversation with the Anime Man CDawgVA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we structured a kind of like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was me and Connor on the stage, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we kind of had
like an MC type of thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who was there to navigate
and ask general questions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like get a flow of conversation going. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And because we asked this MC guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> who was a great MC, mind you,
but it was very last minute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he obviously didn't
know who me and Connor were, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what we do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He only knew like a very
baseline information. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So, obviously, a lot of the questions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were like very general, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but (chuckles) then
there was one question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like something
along the lines of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, I was an MC for your wife, Sidsnap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like looking straight at me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like, "Ah,"
and I looked at Connor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we kind of like met eyes,
and I looked back at the MC, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Could you repeat that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, yeah, your fiance
and wife Sydney or Sidsnap, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she was telling me all these stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about planning for the wedding
and all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was a murmur
happening in the crowd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just like slowly pulled
my hand out, and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm Joey, by the way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nice to meet you."
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, "No, no,
you're Grant or Garnt, right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Is this really happening? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Is accidental racism happening
live on stage right now?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think people in the
crowd were kind of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Ah, yeah, funny bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Got nice execution, nice landing guys." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And meanwhile, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "This motherfucker literally
confused me with Garnt." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what? All Asians look the same now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that how it is? (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Congratulations on getting
married to Sydney, by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you. Thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hope the wedding goes well. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, I've been
planning for a while now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know how it is. Whew!
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think Alan said it best last night, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Wow, I can't believe he
confused the Anime Zone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with the Anime Man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Easy mistake, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Easy mistake.
- It's an easy mistake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Easy mistake, yeah.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Aw, when you put it that way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's fair enough."
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - None of you are watching anime, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, he would love
us to watch an anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I could sympathize with him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He kinda got dragged to do it last minute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I could tell when like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was like trying to
double down on it on our cast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the thing where I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, no, come on, dude."
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, "No, I'm sure
it was something, something." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, "No, just move on, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then there was a
moment during the panel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like people in the
crowd started to laugh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when he doubled down, and
just like wouldn't land. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he just like put both
his hands in his face, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was just like, "Oh no,
I've made a horrible mistake." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like-
- Aw- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, don't worry, man.
- I feel so bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's fine. It was funny." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was funny and harmless, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and, you know, great
story for the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, "It's whatever." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, but other than that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why are you Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You are Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am not Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You are Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Why are you Garnt?
- Oh, God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but that was an interesting- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got somethin', </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like I got recognized in
some interesting place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, (laughing) one funny thing
that happened actually was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so, I got recognized by someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and took a picture with them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were like, "You're
not gonna believe this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw the most convincing Sydney lookalike </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've ever seen in my life."
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Oh, okay, let me
see this. What's that like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna see if there's
a my wife lookalike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Sidsnap is funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He slightly like gets out's
phone, puts the picture on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> starts swiping like furiously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he goes, "Look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Does that not look like Sydney?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's him standing next to Sydney. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pretty damn good look-alike. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, "My guy,
I think that's just Sydney." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, "No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me show you another picture." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So he shows me a full body
shot of Sydney, (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, I think you just
got a picture of Sydney." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna know what Sydney
looks like in this guy's head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the real Sydney, what it
looks like in this guy's head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, how did he take a picture of Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like explain it to her? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because what he explained to me was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, you don't understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I asked her if she was
Sidsnap, and she said, "No." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] What?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because Sydney being
the troll that she is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes she's like, "Are you Sydney?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She's like, "No."
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So this guy's like,
"Can we take a picture? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just gotta, you look
so much like Sydney, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just need to take a picture." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So Sydney takes-
- I can't believe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he was convinced by that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like, "Well, I
guess she's not, then." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, he's like, so what
he was saying was he told me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, she looks like Sydney, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she sounded like Sydney, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but she told me she wasn't Sydney." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, this British dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so there was an American Sydney look-alike </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think he thought she must
have been cosplaying Sydney. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, that's a wig, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what you really wear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He was saying, "It's
your girl?" (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't believe Sydney
committed to this like at heart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember 'cause like
I was with a friend... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause we were outside a
hotel, and I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause he refused to believe me (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it was like Sydney. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm like, I turned to my friend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can you go get Sydney please?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was just like sort
of like shell shocked, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it was like speech a hundred. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney had like convinced him
that she just was not Sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by saying one line that
"I am not Sidsnap." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, so my friend gets Sydney, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the first thing she says
is, "You stupid motherfucker." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joe Baden. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joe Baden. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love how all it took
for Sydney to get away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from that situation was
her just saying, "No." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Meanwhile, this guy's in
a full fuckin' disguise, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he can't get away with it at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe I should've just been like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, I'm not-"
- You should've just been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like, "Are you CDawg?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "No."
- No, I'm not CDawg. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then, it's like, "Oh,
well, fuck, I guess not." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Oh, I love your videos." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Who? What videos?
- "Who? What?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I don't watch-
- "Do you know who we are?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - YouTube videos."
- You did it again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, to be fair, you
weren't CDawg that weekend, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were CDawgz. (laughs)
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> One of my favorite pictures
of the entire weekend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just your like face of just confusion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in front of your picture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't even like me pulling a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just walking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he was literally just walking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just like took a candid shot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of Connor just being like, "Ugh," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of a sign that said CDawgzVA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just looked like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Your face just looked like
you had just gone through, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you'd seen the end of the universe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you wanna explain what happened? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Could you explain what this is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So at the signing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we had like a dedicated
section for our signing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There was a picture of all three of us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that said Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there was individual photos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of like The Anime Man, Gigg. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, (chuckles) next to that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was a picture of Connor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's instead of saying CDawgVA, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it said, CDawgz with a Z, VA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember, I was admiring
the posters, being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh yeah, we look sick in these." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I did a double take
with Connor, it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "C, what?" (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> He said, (laughing) "I
don't know what's CDawgzVA." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Me neither. I liked the name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was just like, Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you should change your name to CDawgzVA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It looks so sick."
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then we'd come in the next day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just like black tower mark, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I laughed even harder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was the most like inconspicuous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, yeah, then to pretend
that never happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - They fixed it.
- We got this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They fixed it.
- They fixed it eventually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just kind of felt, I
was like, "I don't care." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone kept carrying out to me like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Wow, you must be so offended." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Why would I give a shit?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I've had that happen before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've had that happen before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was just like,
"I don't really care." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not like I'm suddenly
now like a different person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not like a file location </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where if you type in the wrong thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like dot C, dot EXE is missing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I'm still here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - At least, the large
majority of your name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was still there and intact. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I've been to a convention
where they had a sign up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it said, "The Anime Guy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm just like,
- The Anime Guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - "That's just a completely
different person." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They must have done that
on purpose to fuck with you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, they weren't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They genuinely thought
I was The Anime Guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I didn't have the heart to tell them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the time.
- Yeah, just another timeline. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was just like, "All
right, you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's good enough. Fuck it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, for me, like
every convention I go to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a 50/50 chance of
whether it be Gigguk or GiggUK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That is like, I swear, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> half the conventions I go to
is just GiggUK, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess it's our fault </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for having confusing names.
- You're in London, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it should've been GiggUK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it makes sense, right?
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's when we go to like Australia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it'll be GiggAUS, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, GiggAUS. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or just GiggUS. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - In like US. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - GiggUS in America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, like another
thing like I noticed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just like every time you
hang out with your mates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you were somewhere where
you think you're private, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like if someone mentions that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wouldn't this be a funny
time for you to get noticed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is like the worst fuckin', </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like summoning the
devil, it is going to happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ¡Cause that happened to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, it happened to me indirectly, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, so we were outside a hotel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we were just chilling out there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was pretty late at
night. It was about 1:00 AM. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we see this guy just
stumble over to like the tree, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and he just starts throwing up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were just like, "Fuck, who is..." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Is he all right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's obviously not in
the right state of mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno where his mates are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we go over to him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's obviously had too
many drinks that night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And unfortunately, he didn't
know where his mates were, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which if you're watching this,
guy, if you're watching this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you happen to be
a Trash Taste watcher, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get better mates. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't leave your
mates out like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's quite fucked up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, he was by the tree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Luckily, some guys, like
a father had found him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and was trying to make
sure that he was okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so we went over and
started to help out as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to make sure that he
was kosher and everything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making sure that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was all right, he was gonna get home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So we managed to contact his
sister, and keep in mind, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this like 1:00 AM, 2:00 AM, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like he's just out here
in the middle of London, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she was like, I believe,
on the other side of London </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And we were like, "Can you
come pick your brother up?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, being, being the
gigachad sister that she was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she's like, "Yeah, yeah,
just tell me where he is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just let me get there now,
I'll come bring him home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we were with him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like a good like
half hour to 45 minutes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> making sure he was okay,
making sure he was warm, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> making sure he wasn't too passed out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's nice.
- And just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hopefully being a good Samaritan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while waiting for this mythical sister </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to come pick him up.
- Being a good replacement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for the shit mates </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he particularly has.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so we're with him for
half an hour to 45 minutes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I go into the toilet quickly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then as I come outside, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently when I was in the toilets, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this mythical sister comes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, thank you so much for
taking care of my brother. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm so sorry. I dunno what's
happened to his mates. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno what's happened to him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll make sure he gets home okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like the next line, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the line I heard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as I was walking out the
door to go outside again was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "By the way, did you guys
see the Trash Taste boys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in MCM today?
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, the sister said this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, the
sister said this, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - My mates told me it was
like sitcom level timing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She was like so compassionate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she was just
trying to make conversation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, she just mentioned, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Did you guys manage to
see the Trash Taste boys?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You just like slowly back inside, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, and then the
automatic doors open. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then everyone looks
at me, and she just goes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, no! You?!"
(Joey and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you were on the
phone with her, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I wasn't on the phone with here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was someone else on the
phone, but they had mentioned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we had a bunch of guys
taking care of her brother. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like the guy who was
just like chatting to him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to make sure, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to know what the
fuck happened to him tonight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and make sure he felt
comfortable and that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she was just like, "You
were taking care of him?!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You!? You?!" (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like, "Are you the sister? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you the mythical sister?"
And she's like, "Yes." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, first I said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Thank you so much for being amazing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could tell like she was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to hold in her excitement. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, she pauses for a second. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She looks at her brother,
dead on the floor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I know this is a bad time,
(Joey and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but is it cool if I ask for a picture?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no! It doesn't
even sound real, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 100% it happened, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Look, you were like such a gigachad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for coming all the way
out here, like 1:00 AM. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily, we had other people
to take care of her brother. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We take a quick picture, she
goes home, and everyone's safe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's safe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please tell me the
brother was in the shot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like in the background.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like that mean picture of the guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like leaning towards the
grave and like doing that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Except it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the brother's just like
dead on the floor, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That doesn't even sound real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it sounds so like in between his ass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It does, it was like so surreal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] That's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One of the funniest things that
happened to me that weekend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yes, it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you just have like
really weird coincidences </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and weird timings with shit, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is like the words you
must never utter at a con. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Of like, huh, what if? Hilarious, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then almost every single time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, "Oh, hi," from a distance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck's sake. Where's the canned laugh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where's
the live audience? (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Aside from MCM, though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how is your guys experience
being back in the UK now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This is your second time-
- Good, good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Only my second time, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno if you had a lot of chance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to explore England outside of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, we've been in... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause the MCM in London
is kind of outta the way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we've kind of been just
kind of contained there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like the first time I was around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think in like 2017,
2018, whenever it was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was mostly in Brighton at Garnt's place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I think I was only in London
for maybe like a day or so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think this will be
like my first proper time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like getting to check it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've already seen way more of London </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than I ever did last time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so, yeah it's been, it's been chill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean the weather's been
fantastic this weekend as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like everyone was like, "Oh yeah," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I tweeted about like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yeah, I'm landing in London soon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Haha, it's gonna be sick." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And everyone was just like,
"Weather's gonna be shit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Shit weather, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Expect the shit weather."
- It's been good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and I landed, and I was just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Brought the red carpet.
- What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> This is shit weather, you guys?! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally, I remember the
first day meeting you all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like, you couldn't
ask for like better weather. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was literally clear skies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was clear blue skies.
- Yeah, it was like warm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like not too hot, like
nice and toasty, bright. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, perfect, sunglasses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like having a coffee
outside type of weather. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone was like, "Yeah,
shit weather, shit weather." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "Oh man, you
guys got it good here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Apparently though, it was
just like an absolute fluke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like everyone was like,
"Damn, this is fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's actually good weather here. Jesus." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think around this time
of year it's okay, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is a pretty good time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to come to London.
- Because the last time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like the biggest
heat wave in like 30 years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever it was.
- That's like every year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the biggest heat
wave every fuckin' year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We get one week, or in your case, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like the one month of just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was really fuckin'
hot that time you came. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like holy shit.
- I remember that time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the heat wave in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just we are not built for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was just like, "Where's the AC?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Where's the AC?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - We don't have any. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, yeah, it's been good so far. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't really done anything. Oh God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Dude, I haven't really awkward
interaction at the hotel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was really like (gasping) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was of an awkwardness.
- Which one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor gasping) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, so we were in the hotel bar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just talking to all our friends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's the Sunday,
it's after the cons end, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone's just chilling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're all just hanging out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying goodbye to all our friends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this person was like
pretty chill at first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like they would kind
come up and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, hi, do you wanna drink or anything?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Oh no,
it's okay, it's okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I got my friend to
buy me a drink instead. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't that their money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, they were kinda
like, just kept saying hi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's chill, 'cause
people do it all the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, probably a couple of
drinks deep at that point? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If someone's having a bunch of drinks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and enjoying themselves,
they wanna be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh my God. Yeah, hi, you're there." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, whatever. I don't mind that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I noticed that like
whenever we would like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I went outside or like
any of you guys went outside, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they would like kind of like
also then happen to go outside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the same time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just listen to whatever
you're talking about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, you know, I'd go
to the toilet, then suddenly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were in the toilet as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Okay, this is like," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, a little sauce,
but like nothing happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, "All right,
cool, cool, cool. It's chill." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's kinda like tailgating
a little bit, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it just kinda
like watching, I guess, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is, obviously, it's like not ideal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's nothing bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like I'm more like,
"All right, whatever." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then like you guys went to bed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there was only maybe
like six of us left. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were chilling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there was like two couches, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's like an empty space </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because obviously, you guys
had gone to bed and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they came over, and they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, do you mind if
I like take the seat?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like 1:00 AM, so
it's kind of winding down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, I don't really
think that's appropriate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause like no one really knows you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't really know me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, you know, it's
kinda weird and stuff." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they were like, "Oh, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, do you mind if I
just introduce myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to everyone then?"
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like (inhales deeply) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, no, I don't think
that's like the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I appreciate it, but like, no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it makes this a bit uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So the doing intention is there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but they clearly didn't
quite read the room- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was trying to be as like polite, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like no as possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like there's still
somebody who, even though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess some people would be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, you have the promotion
to be like 'fuck off' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at that point." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause people say that, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I still don't wanna do that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like to me, it's like,
"There's still a person." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't wanna be that guy, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They shoot at their
shot, and it didn't work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And they should've just
given up at that point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But then, after I said
that again, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "No, I don't think that's..." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Come on, man, like no," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They just kinda like
stood there awkwardly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just like looking at us. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, it was just kinda like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all my friends were
just looking at me like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like "Yeah, please do something." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, "Okay, all right, man, bye." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wouldn't leave, and then one
of our friends just goes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck did he say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like, "Just please leave us alone." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he was begging in
like a pleading way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like, "Please just leave us alone." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Please! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Please, just leave us alone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I know who. I think
I can guess who the guy is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was such a like desperate
way that the person was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, yeah, sorry,
sorry, sorry." (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, "Oh no," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but that was really funny
the way he said that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing)
It was really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please, leave us alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please, leave us alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey whining) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, when you hang out at
the bar at the convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the convention hotel,
this shit is gonna happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if we really wanted
to go somewhere else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and like avoid this shit, we could've. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like we just wanted the convenience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were all staying in
that hotel. It's chill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like when people do shit like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know people get like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "That's fucked up that they did that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Yeah, it's not ideal." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'm also like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "People get excited,
they shoot their shot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They didn't do anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They asked. They didn't just sit down." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause people have done that before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People just fuckin' pull and grab. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but we've been good.
- On the panel, for instance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - See, I'm glad people can now know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that we aren't bullshitting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, like you can... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have the right, anyone
has the right to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, can I join you?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I have the right to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, fuck off."
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'm not gonna get at someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for trying to shoot their shot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you want to, whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it kind of rude and
insensitive to do it? Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the same time- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But at same time,
like respect my privacy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you did it respectfully, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna give you the respect to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> explain it nicely and be like,
"That's not appropriate, no." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And if you don't get it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then (chuckles) maybe one of
my friends won't be so nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'll still be nice, but I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Please just leave alone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just say these stories
'cause it's on my mind, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanted to talk about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I know it's gonna happen again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not gonna be the last time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you ever see me around,
and you ask to sit next to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm probably gonna say no 99... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, fuck it, I am gonna say no 99- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 100% of the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 100% of the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna say no probably
'cause I don't know you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not organic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think in a convention setting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's hard to like draw like
a comfortable line, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Whereas maybe if you
meet someone at a bar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're not with like
a massive group of friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever-
- It's different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - it's different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, definitely different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's you kind of do have to
like read the room sometimes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which I know some people
aren't as in tune with that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as other people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you try not to hold
things against people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unless they like seriously do
cross like a social boundary, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in which case, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe I should listen
to fuckin' Ditus more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and just be like, "Sorry man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you use the man technique? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, did you use the man- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I dunno, I think I just waffled on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for 10 minutes
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Just being like, "No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Here's another reason why no.
Here's another reason why no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Here's another reason why." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If he would've just said, "Sorry, man," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> then they would be like, "All
right, man, I respect that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "I respect," that's
what we should've said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to that guy who came on stage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, he was right all along! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I should've just turned
and being like, "Sorry man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Sorry, man, this just
aint' the place, man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was this one dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I like (chuckles) still
don't know what his deal was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, we were at the bar with John, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and John was talking
to me, and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "John, man, yeah, it sucks, dude." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Yeah, it kind sucks." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Super Eyepatch.
- Super Eyepatch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sorry, sorry.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did it, I did it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You literally just did it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did it, I did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What did you tell Garnt before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But we've said John like
a million times, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I should've said Kevin too.
- It's just there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so many other John's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally, such a common name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was in my own head, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, that's my bad. I suck, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I was telling Super Eyepatch Wolf, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Yeah, man, it sucks, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't feel like I can't
really like experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a con the way I used to." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then while (chuckles) I'm
telling this story to John, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy who must have
been like 40 or 50ish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just shouts full on from across the bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Hey, Connor,
Connor, you want a drink? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You want a drink?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Nah, I'm good man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And John was like, "You know that guy?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "No fuckin' clue." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know, it's just like so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get it because that
happened to me a few times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in other conventions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was nice enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He just asked me, and I was like, "No." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was it. That was it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they shout your
name in such familiarity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that even I have to
double take to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Do I know this guy?"
- Yeah, yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know what I mean? (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like a few times
when I hang out with mates, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I will hear like,
"Garnt, hey, Garnt." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, "Oh it's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wait, I've never met this
man in my life." (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like friend of a friend? No? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't offer me a drink. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm privileged," as you
all say, so don't fuckin'... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't need it. I'm good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He can buy his own drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I buy my own y'all, I promise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I appreciate it, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some people are just nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had one time I was
in London last time... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I never told this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like someone in
like a Mexican restaurant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like the thing in the movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "That person over there
wants to buy you a drink," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when the waiter came over, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is fuckin' cool.
Yeah, I'll have it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He bought me like the strongest
drink on the fuckin' menu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like (coughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like trying to spike you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So then I realized, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I'm not doing this again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not letting them choose the drink." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The weirder one for me is like the ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like just in passing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but you're also like not too sure either </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the lack of information. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's the ones where you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're in the hotel lobby, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're trying to get
to the toilet or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then a person is walking past you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just very
briefly have eye contact, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they just go.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they walk off, and
I'm just like, "Do I know you?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is something like
"The Number 23" shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, "Wake up." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "Wake up." (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That does happen a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does happen a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's not until I turn around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and sometimes, they'll
turn around and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, love you stuff," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like, "Hope you're
having a good night," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, maybe they're just
being friendly. I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like, it's just the silent nod. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what? Is this code
for something? (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, but it's cool, though.
(Connor burps) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, that's the one
thing, I guess, as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've just been like kind
of getting back used to again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like, I personally
have been stuck in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the past three years now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like stranger friendliness
is not as big of a thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as it is, say, in like the UK, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially in a con
setting, so it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just getting used
to just random people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just being like, "Hey." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we've gone from like-
- It's strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like it has been
like just us readjusting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and reacclimating to con culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's been like such a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We've gone from like zero to like 200% </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like the span of a day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it just like, I'd forgotten, one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how intense it was before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like before COVID and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And now, it's like even
more intense 'cause, one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> COVID'S happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone's even more
excited and enthusiastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And also, we are way more recognizable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's just kind of like all culminated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into this massive stirring pot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know like for me it was... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I caught myself being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh man, it's been such a long time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since I've been to a con," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's so many
times during the signing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like, 'cause you're
meeting so many people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you start to get into like
a pattern of things to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, you start off with the hello. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, "How's your con experience been? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How's your day been?" whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then (chuckles)
there was so many times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like people would be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "I hope you enjoy your time in the UK." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'd be like, "Yeah, you too." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> As if they're not from here. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, there was a lot of people actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are like not from the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but it's like clearly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> every time I said "you
too" to that question, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was always the most like
British sounding person ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, yeah, as if
they don't live here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "Ah, damn it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I said that a
few times, not to that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but like, "Oh, thanks a
lot for your content," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I go, "You too." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "How did you know?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, it's not a con experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We had a cab back, me and
Joey and a few other friends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was like 41 pounds, this cab ride. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> This, this cab ride. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you know, I went to go pay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I gave the guy, 'cause
I only had like 10s, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I gave the guy 50, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, in my head, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, it's been like three years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like since I've been
like tipping normally." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I know that sometimes
you tip cab drivers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in London and stuff, and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, yeah, yeah, I forgot about this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I never took cabs
when I lived here before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously, it was late, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we were in like the middle of nowhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I pay this guy, and then he's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll give you the change. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just get out the car, and
I'll give you the change." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So I get out the car, and
I'm kind of just tired, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like 3:00 AM. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, "Bro, I just wanna go to bed." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so the guy, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, so can I have my change?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause the way I tip, I
don't know if you do this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I want all my change first- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then you give some back? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then I will be like, "Here's
here's your tip," right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so (chuckles) I was like,
"Oh, can I have my change?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, "What?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And he looked at me like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I asked for change, and
then he just looked at me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like he wanted me to take it back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like he wanted me to pretend like I did- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Say sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Say sorry.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Bro, what the fuck?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was gonna tip him, and now
he's being weird about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and now I wana tip him less. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'm like, "Just
gimme my fuckin'..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Nine pounds is a lot," right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is not America. We don't tip 20%. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was gonna give him like
a five. That was my plan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I was like, "You're
being weird about this, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just gimme my fuckin' money back, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'll give you some back." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "What the fuck, dude?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so, I'm like,
"All right, yeah, yeah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Can I have my change?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he like looks at me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Again, I wanna say it was the most awkward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five to 10 seconds of my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt like Za Warudo in Jojo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could feel the one second, two seconds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like he was trying
to figure out if I was drunk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was fine, but I felt like
he was trying to see if like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like, (inhales deeply)
"Can I get away with this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And so he goes into his car,
he like rummages around, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he comes out, and he
just gives me five pounds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Dude,
all right, okay, fine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's probably thinking like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Maybe if I just give him some money, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he might just shut up about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was gonna give you
the five pound notes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now you got four pound
because you're being a dick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm like, "Just gimme my money back, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'll tip you!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "What the fuck?!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like,
"What a weird experience." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Meanwhile, the people in the
car were just like vibing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They know that I'm like
having like this mind battle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with this cab driver. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "Just tip him." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was gonna give him money,
and he was making it weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Why are people like this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone else was in the car
just like kind of chatting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like dead
on the fuckin' backseat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> not knowing that this is happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was just like, "Bro, okay." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so he got his four pound tip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jokes on you, you'd have
got a five pound tip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> if you'd just giving
me all my change, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is just a weird experience
you don't get in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They just give you it back immediately, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you never have to deal with this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was just so weird
just seeing the guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just not wanna give me my fuckin' change, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "Me no speak English." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about like transport
in London, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I guess like there has been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a talk of the town since we got here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because everyone that I've hung out with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> can't stop talking about
this Elizabeth line </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that has just fuckin' opened up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I like heard about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like some like fancy new line </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like recently
opened up or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so apparently, it's
this line that's been planned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was meant to open,
I believe, in like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh many years ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, like 2020, I
believe, that it's opened? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nothing in the UK
ever gets done on time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it got delayed.
- Nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It got delayed, but
like the hype was real. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought like, "I'm coming to London, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm coming to a convention,
people would be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Oh, have you started
watching "Spike's Family?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you watching any new anime?'" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, everyone's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yo, you've been on the Elizabeth line." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing)
"Have you been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the Elizabeth line?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I haven't yet.
- I haven't yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I haven't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I swear to God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone could just like have
given birth the day before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'd be like, "Baby, nah, bruh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Elizabeth line, that's the real hype, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I gotta try </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the Elizabeth line."
- Real shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But from what I heard, it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's a air conditioned
line," and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Isn't that just every train in Japan?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And heated seats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't notice that actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the series of questions we got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> were very different to
how the list of questions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would normally get at signing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like before Trash
Taste, it was always like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "What do you think about this anime? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you think about this manga? " </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And there was like definitely
some amounts of those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think the top three
questions I received </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> during that entire
weekend, number one was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Have you had a Tesco meal deal yet?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Number two was, "Have
you been to Greggs yet?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes!
- And number three was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Have you been to Spoons yet?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like nothing to do with anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was all just like, "Have
you had these things?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you had any of them? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah, you took me to
a Spoons last time I was here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but apparently, you took me
into like the worst Spoons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was the worst
Spoons. It was the worst Spoon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But no, I still haven't had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a Tesco meal deal yet.
- Oh, bro, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really want a Greggs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I haven't had a Greggs yet at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I mean, we're here for a little, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've forgotten how passionate
people are about Greggs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Greggs is the bakery? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's the bakery.
- Okay, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so more than that, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the experience.
- It's so much more than that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just a bakery, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I feel like you have
to go there at least once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to get your British passport,
that's the last test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's really weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I didn't realize
how unknown Greggs was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to people outside of England. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because a lot of people British people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we speak about Nando's,
we speak about Spoons, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but like not a lot of people
speak about Greggs abroad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just one of these British things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that if you're in England, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you would've been to a Greggs
at least once in your life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You might not always talk about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's part of being British. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I didn't realize this
until I came back to England, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone started asking me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if I'd gone back to Greggs yet. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's important. Greggs
is an important thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel from what I heard from people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I feel being British
person and not going to Greggs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like being a Japanese person
and not going to FamilyMart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like that level of
like, how have you not- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me, it's even more than FamilyMart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you can find
FamilyMart all over Asia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like all over Asia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like FamilyMarts
in Thailand, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like 7 Elevens.
- I didn't know that either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is news to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's not like a specific... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's obviously very Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so like I'm gonna assume
it started in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's like expanded, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like I believe Greggs
is only available in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's nothing- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So there's like a really British pride. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So, it's cheap, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and it tastes amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, what's not to like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Best sausage rolls, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why haven't you guys taken
me there yet? I wanna go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I actually haven't seen any. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the hype
is so real in my head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, not only have
you guys like hyped it up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but like every second British
person I met this weekend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is like, "Greggs, though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bro, Greggs."
- Let me see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where the nearest Greggs is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, real shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let me have a look at that real shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, get your boys some Greggs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there were people being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yo, so like have you been a Tescos yet?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you had the Tesco meal deal?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Not yet." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I knew it was like real shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like people will like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, here's my recommendation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> These are the ones to avoid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> These are the ones that
you should go for." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I didn't realize there were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so many different meal deals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like there were people
like in the signing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There would be like a person
in front of me being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, so here's the
meal deal I recommend." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I knew it was a real shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when like the person behind
them would like interject </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and be like, "No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't spread misinformation like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the real shit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like, "Guys, chill out." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a Greg's 10
minutes away from him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck ya, let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's walk off to London.
- After this episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - After, after.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, I mean like we
talk about Tesco meal deals, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but a meal deal is like a lot of choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you need to like
have the optimal order. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, there's just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like Blackjack, there's
the perfect way to play it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what a meal deal is, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you need to need to learn
how to count cards, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Pick the right meal deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you know, there's
certain items in the meal deal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can get where if you
were to buy them individually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it would cost like two pound 50. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you can kind of min
max the price options. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So don't be buying water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't get like a fuckin'
little fruit thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> maximize your cost performance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you don't wanna
go for Walker's crisps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - McCoy's crisp, the big boys as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or the (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or Walker's MAX.
- Walker's MAX. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't just go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like the little fuckin'
basic gas vanilla water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can get like an
Innocent Smoothie as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There only like two pounds thirty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You literally sound like
every person at the signing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's important. It's important. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I knew it was real as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there was like
a bunch of people also, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when they mentioned
the Tesco meal deal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they came up to me and they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, Tesco meal deals are amazing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they opted it by 50 P, and
it's an absolute travesty." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I wish I could feel your anger right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it seems very real." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's one like a one-minute
walk, not even one minute, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's literally opposite our hotel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, fuck yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was this article in the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that some doctor was calling
for meal deals to be banned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're too unhealthy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they're too like appealing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. (laughs) Appealing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because people just buy
these like every day for lunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's such good value for money, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they taste fuckin' amazing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they're really bad for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause the sandwiches are
like absolutely just stuffed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with awful stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's like a McDonald's burger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, you don't wanna
know what goes in, but you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it tastes so amazing.
- But it tastes good, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why does it taste so damn good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What does Ronald put in those-
- FamilyMart sandwiches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are exactly the same as well, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, you know the
sandwiches are not fresh at all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But they still taste good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They taste really fuckin' good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I guess, it's like going back to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like why people are
recommending you what to order. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kinda like going to a
Chinese restaurant from here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and ordering like compow
chicken or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, "I've had Chinese food." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then everyone would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, you have not had Chinese food." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like going on Pan Express. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, "Yeah, I love Chinese food." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not even the meal deal guy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but if you're gonna try one out, Joey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least try like the optimal meal deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We'll get the real experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then we can argue about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Fair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some of the sandwiches
come with an additional slice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just for free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like just outta the generosity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not like a
secret menu or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't have to say like a code word? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Normally, it's like two slices, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but some of them for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have like one
sandwich and a half in it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and no one knows why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's one of the great
mysteries of the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like they're just
trying to figure it out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if you've like truly optimized it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if you're a real player, you'll know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You see the (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's how you've gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through like everything
in the menu, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So you know the good shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've had a pot noodle yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck, I wanna have a Bombay bad boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that like the cup noodle... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's like a cup noodle here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, the spicy one is
so good. It's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I wanna experience this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, all right, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess if someone- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just scared that you
might not like this stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'll be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "This is literally my entire
existence is waiting on this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if don't you don't
like this, I'm gonna die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, look, there's a lot of food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that is considered awful
that I absolutely enjoy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I mean, how bad... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Famous last words? How bad could it be? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gotta be honest, Joey.
You've gotta be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We wouldn't be the Trash Taste
podcast if we weren't honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I keep forgetting how
shit mayo is as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Huh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I keep forgetting how bad mayo is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've gone back to not eating mayo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had one sandwich </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause like Japan has
conditioned me to being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Mayo taste good." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always want the for my entire life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I come back to England
and have one sandwich, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't it, I don't like mayo again." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I always forget. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just assume everywhere
has Kewpie mayonnaise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "Oh no,
that was like a delicacy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Should've bought your own. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like some real shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've kind of like come to this realization </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's a small tangent,
but before the boys came here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I did go on like a quick trip to Belgium, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I ate a lot of bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, oh, oh, oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I ate a lot of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm awake now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically every meal,
I'd ordered the meal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'd get a loaf of bread.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it wasn't like the same loaf- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - A loaf? (chuckles) Like a little bun? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I'm not talking about- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a loaf? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They basically gave me half a loaf. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, wow! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I swear God,
- Damn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - every fuckin' meal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like even if it wasn't a meal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if I ordered a drink
with like some quick snacks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They just give you bread plentiful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Belgium knows what's up, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you like bread? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I like bread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (hands clapping) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's character
development right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna do a proper </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like bread tasting stream or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I actually try proper bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I kind of realized
that maybe my entire life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't have shit taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe my entire life, I
just grew up in a place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that just had shit food. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just had shit bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Shit bread, you know? (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can get good bread in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You just didn't seek it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just need to like seek
it out, where it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd have to go to like specialty places. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so good, though. Fuck, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is like true for a
lot of cuisine in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like, you kind
of get good stuff here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just have to seek it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, so what's your favorite bread now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like your favorite kind? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I just tried a lot of bread,
and they all tasted amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to get more informed in bread, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, I just got
given bread, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "They have the same bread."
- I want bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - My man's finally getting
that bread. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love it when they give you bread, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they give you like a
little fuckin' olive oil </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of dip thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like spices.
- Yeah, like the balsamic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I love that!
- And you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, don't mind if I do." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, "Ooh, ooh."
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck, I love bread so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every time I go to like
an Italian restaurant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the states,
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - and they give you like
that bread with the olive oil </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the balsamic, I'm
like, "Fuck the pasta. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Just gimme more of this shit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (phone chiming) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I guess I just
got a text from Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (mobile chimes) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wait, Garnt just found a new Waifu. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> I think spending money in
England is way too easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt sighs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just tapping that card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like monopoly money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like I know the US has contactless. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan has contactless, but like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the form of Suica. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't use at like
restaurants and stuff, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like for like other places, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and cab rides.
- It is getting better, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor And Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I did notice
that a lot of places... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like in Australia as well now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, everything is
just like, tablets, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, like in the UK now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it just seems to be that
like the default is now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the tapping the credit card. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's way too easy
to spend a lot of money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just something pops up, you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't even know how much it is," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> fuckin' tap and then you're
like, "I'm broke now, shit!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like I remember
like the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they bring that out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just kind like
hand it to you to like tap, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm so used to doing it in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I pulled my phone out
to get my Suica ready, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was just like,
"Nope, that's not it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's credit card. It's credit card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Think you could do
with your phone, though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you had the right thing set up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And 'cause I'm so used to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even in Japan when you do
like the whole tapping thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> not only can you see how
much money you've spent, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's also like there's
a little bit of a process, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so like, you know, kind of get it going. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But in the UK, it's literally
just boop, and you're done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we've contactless here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they have like a specific
device for contactless, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or they'll like show you the
side with the contactless on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's not the side with the price on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so you don't even know
how much you're spending </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the time.
- Yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like I realized after
coming back this time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they've increased the limit again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So when first contactless
started coming out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I believe the limit-
- 30. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - was like 20. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, it was at 20? Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then it increased to
30, and then, I believe, 40, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and now it's like 80. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We just fuckin' doubled the amount. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ!
- With a single tap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of your card, you can spend
a hundred bucks. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's so scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I realized how dangerous this was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause we're at the convention, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like buying a round
of drinks, and I didn't... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Normally in Japan, they at
least like tell you the price. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They tell you the price of
how much you're spending, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and here they don't
even tell you the price. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They just assume you know the price, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they give you the contact
thing, and you beep it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I bring back the drinks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I remember one of my friends asked me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "oh, are the drinks expensive here?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I would just go- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I didn't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Maybe." (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I feel like, yes is the
answer, but I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and I say, "I think
it's probably expensive," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were like, "No,
is it London expensive? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or is it London hotel expensive?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like, "Yes." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Either one of those two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I probably have to ask
how much drinks are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but right now I literally have no idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just tapped my wallet away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I literally dunno how much I've spent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> while I've been here, because
again, they don't tell you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's literally just like
throwing monopoly money out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] True. True. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And being like, "Yeah, cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was easy. Sweet." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it's only when
you get back to the hotel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, "Oh, fuck." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish it was monopoly money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause at least with monopoly money, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you kind of like know
how much you're spending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You'll know if you're broke.
- I keep track </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of my monopoly money.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I spend it very carefully. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, that's scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause we had a night, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we ended up just like quickly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like as a group mates in the casino. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, we didn't play that much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I played a little bit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I ended up with some
physical money on me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the end of the night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember like cashing out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting this physical money in my wallet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like, this is useless. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When am I ever going to spend this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When am I ever going to
spend this physical money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they've given me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And because you don't ever
need to spend like cash at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I noticed that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So now it's just like a
paperweight in my fuckin' wallet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Suffering from success. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not even. It's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What am I gonna do with all this money?! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is just suffering from convenience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It is suffering from convenience
that we've gotten to now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] My God, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah, I guess that's
been our return to the UK. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> - Thank you for carrying this episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been like dead for some reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think jet lags still kicking my ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it is a bit.
- I'm like, "Yes, bro." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's also really warm in this studio. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's so hot. I feel
like when I'm in a sauna. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like a little extra warm. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, at least in like Japan,
we have an air conditioner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, in my head, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Can we turn the air con on?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was looking around briefly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Where is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where is it help? Help!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But hey, look at all these patreons. Ooh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, look at all these lovely patreons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot that we needed to shout them out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it doesn't even
feel like Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I know.
- It feels weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, like I was so excited </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to have like the boys come over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we haven't recorded the Trash Taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in like, I feel, like a
month, three weeks, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, almost a month, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not, not only that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but normally at least like
I'm in Japan or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, I had come to the UK early </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to finalize my wedding stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I was just like here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was just like not
talking to the boys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not recording Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like, when
I saw them come to England, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just, I dunno, it just felt nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It feels nice to have the boys back, man. </SPEAKER_04>
