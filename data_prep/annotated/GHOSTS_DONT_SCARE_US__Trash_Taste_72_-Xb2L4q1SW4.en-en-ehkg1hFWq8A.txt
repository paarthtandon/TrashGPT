<SPEAKER_08> - Now survival is just,
the rules have changed man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It used to being a Sigma male man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Now it's hard, now you gotta pay bills. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't be a Sigma male
while I pay the bills, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck that shit.
- Fuck Sigma male, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't pay your bills, number 1. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (bright intro music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hi everyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Welcome to another episode
of the Trash Taste podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm Joey and I'm with the boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hello. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was that the intro? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Man intro, Joey intros
have really gone down hill </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in the past year man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe like salty salmon spices </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or whatever the fuck you started. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are you? The
fucking YouTube comments? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like the old intros better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I like the old studio better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember when Joey put
effort into his intros. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm Joey. You're enjoying
(indistinct) on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I remember when like half of my intros </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> would get the episodes demonetized. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So annoying. We lost
like thousands of dollars. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause Joey's one of those,
couldn't resist being Australian. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Cause Joey was just being Australian. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. I can't help them. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I have to fight the odds
to say all the bad words. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Can you guys tell I'm
absolutely ripped today. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I went to the gym the
first time in two months. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was about, Oh my, what! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm absolutely pumped today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - First time in two months? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - First time in two
months, my body is dying. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - So you signed up to the
new gym at your new place? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - I did. I did. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And it's different, and the
etiquette is slightly different. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> So it kind of threw me off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, did you sign up by yourself? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Impossible. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't believe you.
I don't believe you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was trying to remember how I did it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was confusing because he was, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was all a blur. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - He was asking things, I was like, yes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well that's just
every interaction I have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> with a Japanese person in Japan. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They ask me something and I just say yes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - So here's how good my Japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has gotten to this point now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's kind of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm kind of filling in the blanks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> It kind of feels like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're doing one of those
Mario Party mini games </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where you see a part of the
sequence and you're like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think I know where
this sequence is going. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like going into Mario Party game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without looking at the controls, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Say, I think, I think
this is out of the box. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So now I'm
getting to the point where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm accustomed to the normal
flow of signing up to things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I kind of understand
what they're saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I understood most
of what was told of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> And a lot of it was just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Hey, read this. And I'm
like, Oh, soon. Soon. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just really weird when
they pulled the knife out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe started selling my blog,
I guess that's tradition. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - The rectal exam was
a bit weird, you know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a little longer, but it's so, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So did the signing up take
as long as the original stuff? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> But, I signed up to Anytime Fitness. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, Anytime Fitness.
- Okay. Yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - American chain, I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Is it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. Could we fact check that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Go fact check that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> But listen, when I went in
there it looked American. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because all the gyms,
usually white people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to advertise their gym </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. They do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> At the front of our old
gym, there was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like five banners </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of just like really attractive white guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - I've never seen a Japanese
person be advertised </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> on a gym before in Japan. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was weird how in Japanese gyms </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it is just white people is
like the standard, I'm like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it might just be
because like going to the gym </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in this country is like a fucking luxury </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because of how expensive that shit is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not just that, who the fuck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what Japanese person
has time to go to a gym. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Also most of the Japanese
people are in shape, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> And the, and the people
that aren't in shape. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't think they care
about being in shape. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> They have like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> they're like, I've got
everything I need in my life </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't need to be in shape. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I've got my seven lessons. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - So why are you working out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Honestly, you're just
like naturally in shape. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> Fuck you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - How did you get fat?
How did that happen? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically?
- Yeah. Pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I signed up and I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I'm pretty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Like I said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure I had
time for this is American. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We had a fact check
and it wasn't American. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I shouldn't, it was America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That sounds American. Like joy fits 24. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. That it does not American. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. That sounds Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That sounds like what a
Japanese people think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> American people think that
yes, you're joyful in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your fears and it's open 24. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hours. So it's a joint. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anytime fitness is much
better than I signed up to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> It didn't really know
what the was going on. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> They took my picture. I got the key thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I signed my life away.
They asked for my card. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Yeah. It worked out. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So I believe I'm signed
up. So that's good. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> I walked in yesterday
and nobody stopped me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - One thing I've noticed about
moving is like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> having to cancel memberships
and having to cancel stuff is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like 10 times easier than signing
up to something, which is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Not it's the opposite
in the west, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause like I was dreading having
to cancel my gym membership </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I remember when we
signed up to a gym membership, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it took like 45 minutes to an
hour of just reading forms. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was just like, so me and Cindy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you had to go cancel a gym
membership. And we said one word, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> which was like, we would
like to cancel a membership. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And we had to sign one piece
of paper, took five minutes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why can't signing up? Be that easy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No leaving fees. Just like, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Use the gym until at the end of. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like everything you'll not suppose </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to do as a business. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Right. It's like why? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, I love how, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how hesitant they are to sign
you up to shoot. It's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are you sure you want to give
us money every month? Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's why I'm here. It's just
let me in for Christ sake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Exactly. The moment you leave. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, oh, thank God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> He got to take it and get the out. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I have to change
over my internet as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And that was surprisingly
painless. Cause they were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no worries. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you want to cancel your
incident or did you want to move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to a new place? And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it is which one's easier.
And I'm like, it's the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just what exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, where's the catch? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where's the cat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why is it like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's like pulling teeth
when you're like signing out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fully water or gas up in new places. Like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> are you sure you want water
in your place? It's like, yes, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> please. Thank you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I only just, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So I moved to our current
place, like what five? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Almost six months ago. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I only just finished
finalizing by water stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What really? Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I got like a new bank
account and with the Cayman new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> card and for some reason they
didn't allow me to use my new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bank account because it's not
under the same name or some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of, well, you said, you
said the B word bank in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But I've done it before
at my previous place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was pretty painless. Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, you know, it's
just changing a bank. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How hard could it be
famous? Last question. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I could have been nothing
with the word bank in Japan is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> ever easy, but what I
don't understand, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that okay? So I signed
up and I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to change to my new
bank because like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my money situation has
changed at this new place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were like, sure, no worries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> We'll send you a form. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You can fill out all your
information and then mail it back </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to us. I'm like, yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> All right. Email was also a thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But anyway, so there's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I think about a month after
that phone call, finally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the phone comes in. I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why this
took a month to send out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but she'll fill it in
five minutes, send it off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Two months later, I get a
phone call and they say, ah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> so your bank is not able
to be used on my door. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And I'm like, Chateau, Marty. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You could have told me that
on the phone three months ago. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Why is it now after all this
like waiting and sending out a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> form that you'll finally like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're going to call you up
and be like, yeah, by the way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the rate of inflation has
changed significantly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> In the past two months, we
do details all over again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you been paying
for water since then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So before it just used to
be like a bank transfer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like every month automatically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But since then I've had
to like get the form. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They mail you the form
that says the amount. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I have to go to the
family mod or the company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nearby and do it cash. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Which just like me up because
sometimes I don't check my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mail every day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there was one month
where I almost like got my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> water stopped. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because they just straight
up, didn't send me my form. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, and then they
call me and they're like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you haven't paid for
your thing. I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't give me the floor.
What am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Am I supposed to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> am I supposed to go and go to the light? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Am I supposed to go to the
company being like, ah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> so I don't have the
form, but like, trust me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I know you guys. I have to pay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've realized right when I
first moved here, I thought, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> oh my God, I can pay my
bills at the local company. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Amazing. This is great. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, no, I realize it's
just to avoid banks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. It's just like this whole cut. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This country has set up a system
where the banks just don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> need to do anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but they still got to have all your money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they give you like,
what is it like 0.0, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zero 1% interest assumption. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The interest gets wiped out by every, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> every time you want to take out money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you, you basically, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> there's less interest in the P the, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the fees you pay for like any service. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Japan is the only country where
like hiding your money under </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> your mattress might be a better
investment than putting it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> into a bank. Honestly, it's
probably safe for this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And spend money with a country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that people just don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, why would we give you interest? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> If people are going to keep
money in that bank? What the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Weirdly is like a weed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like money saving
mentality in this country, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even for who have the money to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Spend. So yeah, apparently the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the reasons why they
didn't want to give more money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out to people during the
pandemic is because we just don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> spend the money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So they would just be giving
money that wouldn't help </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stimulate the economy because
people wouldn't go up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Even if you gave them a thousand bucks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> most people were just
going to keep it going to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, it does not surprise me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> because like domestic tourism is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> massive here. It's just a massive. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's like 90% of the economy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - But it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> from what I understand of
the domestic tourism here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is like a massive luxury. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Most people can't afford to
go from what I understand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And also don't have the time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the biggest resource
for any Japanese person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially working is
time. How'd you have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - To do anything. If you
have go to Rio can, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you stay there for two nights, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guarantee you're probably
like one out of 100 people who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are staying there for more than one night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone leaves the next day.
Always I've noticed that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, if I go and park my
car, it's full next day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> empty the car park at like two o'clock. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Cause no one's checking until like fall. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And I'm the only who apparently stayed. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though it makes more
sense to have a hotel room for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these two days, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you at least get
one full day of the room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. That, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that never made sense to me
because how can you enjoy the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> day? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Because that means you spend
most Rio can't and you can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> check until three minutes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> all three or four and they
weren't there you check in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> earlier as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> This space, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if their space with
Japanese hotels and it's not just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> Rio Cannes it's hotels as well. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Even if they have space in the hotel, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you still can't check in
until the check in time. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - You'll have the problem though. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that like the main demographic
that goes to dual cons for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one night is usually like retirees, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> And to them, the con itself is the. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But you know what sucks is the
fact that you don't even get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> like a full 24 hours when you buy one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Now that's why in my head
I'm like, so in efficient, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> like you should never ever,
like, even if you stay in, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say you're staying in Kyoto. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You shouldn't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you should never change hotel
every night because you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just wasting time wasting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasting time that you could
have in the hotel room. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You get the breakfast as well
or whatever. I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You count your backgrounds
to pain in the. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Plus plus like
when I'm on holiday, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I'm staying in a hotel or Rio camp, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what I want to relax, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't want to think about
what time I need to wake up the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> morning after that's true. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I want at least one
day when I'm just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if I want to lie in, I can lie in. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I want to crack some
beers open with the boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to know me. They be
lying until like 10 o'clock, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> But in Rio cans you have to
wake up at aides because most </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> people are only staying there
for one night. And you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they, they have to wake
up early to check out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's all on Japan side of
things like having to sleep or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> getting to sleep in is
like the privilege way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you would stay here for more
than one night without you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> privileged. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I, there was when I went to
Rio con I went to one and I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> remember I was just, I loved it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I was absolutely
appalled that they made us check </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out at 9:00 AM. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was really privileged. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if this is my privilege. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'm 9:00 AM not 9:00 AM
broken me a chance to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> brush my teeth and wake up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - At night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to check out a non am. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I guarantee like earliest
check-in is like, for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thing. It's like, what are
you cleaning for so long? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, not surely this
cannot take that long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> The one thing that I love about
like American hotels is that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> whenever I've always
asked for late checkout, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> or they've always given it to me, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's just like an hour extra, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the always chill about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> like sometimes they made me
they've charged me like 20, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> 30 bucks extra, but Japanese hotel. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I remember one time I sit in a
hotel room in Niigata and the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel room itself was $90
for an extra hour. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Was $70 just for one extra
hours to stay in the room past </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 11. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, whoa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, did I hear that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Correct? Can you, can you say that again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My once you don't blink
like 70, the room was 90. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How does that make any
sense? Tell me like sit down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I think to them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything past that time limit
is an extra day to them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That offering late checkout
without offering late checkout. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? Like it's
like, we got late checkout, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's not really late
checkout, but it is late checkout. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes empty as well.
It was like Pete Corona. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There was nobody staying here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why don't you trying to swindle me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're fighting for their life, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They need that extra money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, oh, let's try this guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'll give you I'll. I know, I know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's not culture. I'll tip you, man. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Just leave me alone. Don't
charge me 70 bucks for this. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> What do I need to do?
Who do I need to stop? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's weird though. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Because like most like high-end
dual cons, especially they, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> they usually quiet, lenient
with a late checkout and stuff. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like we just, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> myself and AKI and a few
others just came back from this </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> deal in Yamanashi. And like they said, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> the checkout was like nine 30, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> but we were there to like 11
and then we'll like, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Then why you kicking us out at nine 30? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If that's the case count, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> did you ask them for late
checkout or were they just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They said the night before
they were like, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's nine 30 check out. Is that okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we were like, we
might be here for longer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Is that okay? And then we're like, okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> then why did you tell me
that was the checkout time? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like maybe just most Japanese
people just don't ask most of </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> these people. Like those are the rules. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We must follow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really anal about getting
there. If it says 12, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they are so paranoid about
checking out after like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> minute after 12. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's just like Japanese
culture in general though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like we're very strict on
time. Like every time was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nobody has. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tell us. It's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want to be like
fighting for my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 10 minutes for checkout.
Like, oh, I'll come, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll come 20 minutes after.
No one's going to care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No one knows no one has ever cared, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm, I'm trying to enjoy this bathtub. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> You gave me, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Come on. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, how can, how
can you enjoy it when. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're stressed about time? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I guess that's why I'm so
confused as to why people stay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in VO cans for like one night, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> because I feel like you need
a minimum of two nights to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> enjoy the experience three nights. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> If you really just want a
relaxing weekend or whatever, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's, that's, that's
real privilege in Japan. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like I'd never heard of, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> anyone's like a Japanese postal
staying at a dual con for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> more than one night
because to them it's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because to them that one night
is probably the equivalent to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like a week to something
it's like, oh my God, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> finally a night where I'm not
working and just get to like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> do whatever the I want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nothing about your cons
is that there's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they really pressure
you to go to breakfast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm already a breakfast
guy and especially not a real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> con breakfast sky, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I don't need a
three-course meal for breakfast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> which is basically what those
breakfast is. Are what's an. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - American breakfast thing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - They're big. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Breakfast makes American
breakfast looked time. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. Death by a thousand bites, bro. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like they just F they keep
giving you tiny pieces and they </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> keep coming and they
keep, and they won't stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I, you know, you know, it's
over when they finally asked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, do you want some tea or coffee? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But by that point you're already dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They've already stuffed you stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - I actually feel bad when
everyone got mad at you about the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> breakfast tweet and your, and your hotel. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it was, it was like
one of the few times I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I agree with corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm just like, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. I, you don't need that
much for you for breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You really know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just, you know, I'm, I'm a, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm a simple man for breakfast.
I don't really eat it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I tend to eat it. If I've got
something big about to happen, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the cycling special. All right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. I'll have some breakfast, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> cause that's just a
wise choice to exercise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if I'm not exercising,
I'm not eating breakfast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Give me a cereal bar at most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. I'm I'm I'm not really big on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd rather have a nicer lunch. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not hungry when I wake up. No, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not all people can just
wake up and go like, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like a buffet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, no, because like,
if I have a big breakfast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which I've really enjoyed
the big breakfast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> cause I'm not hungry for breakfast. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that means I'm just
not going to eat lunch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or that means I'm going to
get hungry for dinner at this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> really weird time, which is
like a bit early for dinner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like too late for lunch. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like up my eating schedule. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The most as being,
you know, when you like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you kind of hungry when you wake up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe you didn't eat too
much the night before. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then like, it really, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really starts to get hungry at like 11. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the worst time. Cause you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's too early for lunch,
but I'm holding out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I don't want breakfast,
breakfast, but I'm, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm holding out here. I got them life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know all my. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just, I think, I think
what it is is that I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate the feeling of like
having a food coma before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 12:00 PM. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> cause you're just tired in
the morning and I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't want that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Down. A bunch of water when you wake up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yes. I mean, I'm normally
full from that as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Drink, I drink a lot of water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Water a lot more just. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In general. I do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't see why that's
unhealthy hydro home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably probably didn't
like 500 milliliters of water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I drink at least like
minimum two or three cups. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - So just want to get
stuck in with my day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like if I need a shower, I do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I go start working. I just kinda wanna, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kinda want to get on
with my day. I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't really want to sit around. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Like huffing having like a fry up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> That that means something
that means it's like a special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> occasion. You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I can't have a fry up everyday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even recommend you
have a fry every everyday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like even, Even just
cereal to me is just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a big meal for breakfast to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Like a lot of people say
breakfast is the most important </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> meal of the day. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't know how accurate. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh, that's the cereal companies. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> The cereal companies have. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Crikey does making us think
that these carbon monstrosities </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> on necessary. I do not need cornflakes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I wake up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The most I'll eat for
breakfast is single bananas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll have this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There were chemicals in the
cornflakes to turn your gay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> something on the frogs game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Rusty's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like the most I'll have for
breakfast is like a banana. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, the fruit companies,
aren't trying to convince me to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> big fruit companies though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause it's like the whole, the
whole, you know, the whole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole chart came from the
pyramid of what you should eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and your day and you should eat this much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just complete nonsense
pyramid scheme. Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And like the whole idea of that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you need to eat these corn flakes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which offers no nutritional
value in the morning and stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like that. Like the bottom, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's like, no, it was all
pioneered by these, you know, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> companies, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but way back that I had an
agenda to promote their stuff. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. And of course, if, if,
if you're the Kellogg's team, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you're gonna have your scientific
research team. Of course, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you're going to be like, Hey,
Kellogg's scientific team. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Could you maybe, maybe not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not looking to have,
excuse me, results. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But like if there was some kind
of correlation that said the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> calyx was good for breakfast,
really help us out again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not saying you should
convince the world that fruit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> loops is healthy or anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> but maybe like a hint at the same. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That contract for five years
is not going to be necessary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> No, one's buying cornflakes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> So yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> I, I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I didn't know what age I just
was like no more cereal for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> me. I won't do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't really ever eat cereal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wasn't, I wasn't brought
up in a cereal household, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I never got the craving of
it. And then a toast house, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not like cereal to me
always tasted like a sweet, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a dessert. Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> You go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - I will say. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've just shat on cereal
for like five minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do like brand flakes. I
really realized I love bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But like I remember one
time, one time as a kid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I discovered bran flakes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I thought these are so good
that I just will keep eating </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> them all day. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> So I had the whole box in one
day and that was me and Coco </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> puffs. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bran flakes is like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - On crack, like, oh Lord,
my toilet activity that day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was, I imagined they had the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were filming Lord of the rings, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mortar scenes out of my bathroom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> Then that time it was
horrible. I was so much. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - Pain. There's nothing
worse than an overly fiber. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - God. I was, I was scared. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I was genuinely scared.
I was like 12 years old. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, why do they
make them taste so good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - So I'm like, oh I, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to have a horrible
diet when I was a little kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - But everyone does, your
parents are like, yes, go on it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> Those gummies that were
made in the ninja turtles. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Cause like, cause like my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> my parents had no retaliation
on giving me my sister, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like Coco puffs and like fruit
loops and like MuTu grain and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> all the like sugary off cereals. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you know, now when
you're a parent, that it's, it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it seems very difficult
because you're already kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> struggling just to just get by. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> The last thing you want to do
is start like comparing cocoa </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> puffs with, you know, it, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> it shuts the kid out for 10 minutes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> give them the cocoa pops. Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But then later on you're like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe I shouldn't have gave
him given that a kid's four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> slices of Nutella bread, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe 50 grams of sugar for breakfast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like it was a
blessing that I didn't like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't discover the teller
until like I wasn't, oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> If I discovered the teller as a kid, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which a lot of people did, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I like my diet would have been destroyed. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - My diet was destroyed
because it's like, oh, okay, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you had cargo puffs for breakfast. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And then my mom would pack
Nutella sandwiches for lunch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And I was just like, how did
I not gain a million pounds? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Luckily when you're
young, it's much easier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> Thank you. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Young, young and Asian. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like the life
hack right there. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - I despised them. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> My mum kept up with what was
healthy because it just meant </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> that I never got to eat anything fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And all the kids around me
always had like under the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's one kid. Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was a bit overweight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but he always had chocolate
spread sandwiches. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just think that sounds so cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> I had a little chocolate bread, man. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm out here eating my cheese
sandwich, like a peasant, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like a king. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's getting chocolate spread
with a chocolate yogurt, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like eating even good. But then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then when he wasn't eating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> his parents unfortunately
set him up to fail. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> It was a good when I
tried it, I thought, oh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> this doesn't taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not no chocolate spread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Doesn't like chocolate
mousse and all that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't really like that. And. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I may maybe just because
he wasn't normalized for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hardly had it. So every time
I did have it, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, I'm having chocolate for a meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> This is, this is a lifestyle right here. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This is. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I love cheese, strings, cheese straight. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Awesome. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's fun. Even now I enjoy doing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I definitely enjoy this process. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't even like
trying to get it as thin, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as possible as well. And just like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Try to get like that. Perfect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Like it's just like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, I dunno if they have this, they. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have shoestring satisfying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Southeast Asia, two strings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They don't think they do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just like this. Like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's in all the
imports. Like supermarket. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not real cheese.
I don't know how they do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know how they get real. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Cheese, but it tastes better
than real cheese in a sense. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> But then it doesn't. But. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like it's like cheese flavored plastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like playing a
mini game to eat cheese. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And for some reason that
just adds the flavor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I used to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> I used to have to do this
thing when I was little. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> I know if I'm the only
one, but like I would, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't like rip it and
then immediately eat it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I would kind of rip it and
try and like create a perfect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> pile. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hannibal Lecter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I like put it
in a rhino, like my finest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - My name is Joseph. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm 12 years old. I live in Melbourne. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> School cafeteria. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Making perfectly cut off
string cheese, this flying it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Never had a cheese missing out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're missing the flavor is. But. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I feel, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel if you're an adult and
you've never had string cheese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as a kid, it's kind of a
toll hurdle to like get. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Th there are some things that
I try nowadays in Japan and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, I've never had
a Japanese childhood, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I feel the childhood in this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of the stuff we tried
in the company episodes right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> With with that crisp thing that was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> that was just like one big it
or whatever and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I've I can feel, I can see
myself eating this as a kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I also have like the
fish cakes, which is vital. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what the kamaboko maybe
like the fish and cheese. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. I had both of those
when I was a kid, I was like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Bro. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like, just anything
that was like of that size. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would just try. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like I realize there's some
things that if you didn't grow </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> up with it, oh, you
probably wouldn't enjoy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like in Thailand, in Thailand, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> we have this snack called Tato, which is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> which is basically just dried fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Quiet Southeast Asia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like, what, what is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's it's just like dried fish. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's like, cause when I think of Tara, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was the purple
a light sweet potato. I. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have no interest associated with. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. So, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I remember like eating this
as a kid and thinking this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tastes amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I brought some back to
England and I gave some to my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mates and they had, they had
a bite and they were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is just fish food. I'm
like this isn't fish food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's that? It's that, it's that one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The fish drinks basically
fishing, like cheese strings, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but we fish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The fish and they did this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shrinks out of everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I mean, I just hear that
story and I'm just like, oh, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> there's you might as over
here being like first time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Got mom every time. Every time I like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause I grew up with Vegemite as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then every time I give that
to someone who's known an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Australian and they eat
and they're like, oh, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this tastes like poison. It. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Tastes good on toast. It's brilliant. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Lovely on toast. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I would just put it on toast. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> There's a spread on tasting. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - We can make it work, but put beans. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - You don't, you don't what
else is actually good at, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with is on rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Made your mind on rice is
actually not bad because if you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> think about it, it's the same
thing as putting it on top. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't know who you offended
more Australian than you or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like the Japanese in you, but you, you, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> you somehow like offended both
your ancestors at the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I definitely got disowned
the moment I said that on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> camera, A rice farm and just died some way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I try to once, because I, I
actually saw it on Japanese, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> on Japanese YouTube though,
because that will like, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> So my Australian friend brought
back this veggie my thing, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I had it on toast thought
it was disgusting. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But then I thought I'm
Japanese put that on rice. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Anything's good on rice fried it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And apparently the guy said
it was good. So I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> all right, well, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> if the guy on the internet
said it was good at Buffalo, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> obviously. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - It must be true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It must be true. If a
Japanese guy said it must be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - The truth of the week
says it's good. I'll try it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Exactly. So I tried it and I
was like, okay, you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Not as good as on toast, but possible. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Possibly. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I sorry to get back to the
gym to bring it up again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was in the gym and I was
watching an anime to go along </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with such gym experience. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the only time
you watch animate, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You've been talking about
watching animate a lot recently, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> twice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Twice. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - That is a lot. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - More times than me. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I want to watch something. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> And then I saw the new
season of backy was out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, well, this
is good, Jim, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I watched it in like my God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if you haven't started
watching Becky, like you need. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - To, I haven't seen this new season yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is probably the greatest season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of television I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This was so funny. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause cause Paul three Bucky, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is the new season is my
favorite bulky bottom line. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly. I've I was
like trying to work out, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I just couldn't stop laughing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like just some of the plot
points honestly puts Jojo to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> shame at times stupid. This. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Show is when it really starts to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Get fun back is I don't
even know how to explain it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just men with muscles
fighting. And it's just so funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically, a kid who's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to be the strongest
creature on the planet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he does everything
he can to be the strongest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's no way we can describe
in words what back here is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> kinda like it's kinda like Joe, Joe, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you kind of just have to explain. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's the reason why it
doesn't do is as well as jokes. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I think, I don't know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It doesn't have like an
aesthetic that is quite as </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> appealing. The stranger judge has so much, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> George has so much style and
stuff to go around with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, but I think Becky
is always more stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Lucky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Kiska is one of those like
illustrators where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you really good at drawing?
Or are you really sharp? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I like, like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There were some things where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's an amazing show. And
then other scenes I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think this man has
ever seen a human being in his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is not how anatomy works. It's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You take a character and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> let's make this a muscly
character. And you're like, well, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what proportions do you
think is reasonable, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> reasonable for a muscly character. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then the author just went, all right, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> multiply that by 10. And then
that's the, that's like the. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Every character, every single character, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> even the weak characters, I
like built like brick house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Right. It's insane. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, I could tell you
some plot points and I will, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> and they won't even spoil it for you. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So you won't make any sense. Right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So at one point during the
show, the main protagonist, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Becky start shadowboxing right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - Is it the mantis? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - So yeah, that as well. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> But so you start, this is, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a 10 year old
kid and he's like, look, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going to show you that I'm
going to fight an opponent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so he starts fighting
the air and then he starts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fighting Mike Tyson. Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This one, this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - One is Tyson appears out of
thin air and Mike Tyson isn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> there. But Mike Tyson is
lending blows and he physically, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> physically gets hurt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he's fighting him
back and then the kids can see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the spirit of Mike Tyson. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And then this just happens. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then he's like, and then
the main character is like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> oh yeah, Mike Tyson's week. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then he just summons a
praying mantis that beats the out </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> of him. But then he starts
fighting the praying mantis, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> this imaginary. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - In a, in a room, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like some military guys
like, Hey, come fight. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he's like, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And then he just kidnapped
George Bush and it's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what's going on? What is. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is going on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then he. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kidnaps in this plot.
He kidnaps George Bush. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> So he can go to prison. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like, so then he can
beat up all the prisoners. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Why would George Bush help
you go to prison? If, if, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you kidnap him, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they would just watch it
doesn't make any sense. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I love how is just like it
is. So with the times, like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> you know exactly when Paul three was also. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Watching Becky, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if you only learned about
America through trash tastes, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's, This they say about it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> There's this one, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I had to pause it cause
I just laughed my off. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And this is one point where
this American prison guard is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> about to die. And the two
Japanese guys, one of them saves, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the Japanese guy saves the
American and the other Japanese </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> goes, why would you save an American? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> He's never going to care
about you. He's American. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I just post it. And he was
like, what, what does that mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> What is the, like, what does this trust? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Americans like compassion.
What is the, what is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - Compassion and my country.
Why would you save it America? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They wouldn't care about. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Holy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> My FA my favorite Bucky's
on the, I'll never figure. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I can't wait for them to adopt this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's part four. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's when Barack Obama comes out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause he gets in the manga.
He's like newly elected. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Right? So it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the era of when this was
written and like how my usual, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> like the main, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> like the dad guy who was
like the most powerful guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he goes to talk to the bomber
because of course he can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sit down to any page you want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Like the main antagonist could
just sit down with anyone </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> just because he's so built different bill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, but like
Obama at first is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've heard of that, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't trust him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't trust them at all. But like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I need to see you see the real deal. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to see if he's the real deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So then he comes into the
room and he's like, show me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're the real deal. And, and
use your, and use your Argos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All right, bet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he grabs like a handful of
sand and he crushes it in his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hand and turns it into a time and. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't even know
what he's going to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then Obama's like
you all the real one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So there's like, this show is muffly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you haven't watched Mackie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are honestly doing
yourself. This is so fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's get past the start.
It can be a little jenky, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but like the animate is
really good. It's really fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like, I'm surprised. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, culture just hasn't
picked up on bikinis, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Because so much of this is meme of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's so funny. So apparently right, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> because these there's these
three characters, Bacchae the, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the, usually a Hanmer and Oliver biscuit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The other guy was just three guys. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> They're so dangerous and so
powerful because their muscles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right that half of the
GPS in the world is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> is on in the air solely to track
this only the track them in </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> this world. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And so whenever they run
above two kilometers an hour, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> the GPS has all the GPS in
the world has to stop working </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just to track these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So there's a whole section
where they explained that when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> people are driving or using their phones, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> the GPS just doesn't work correctly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> Because some of these characters
decided to go for a light </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> jog. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> You can't make this out of this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm telling you like, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> If people, if you thought
Jojo was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Judges witches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It could be as ridiculous as Baki at time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - And you combine that with </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> then also another part in another </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> season where you drove a Honda again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the main antagonist meats,
Mohammed Ali, and he, and he's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like, you could, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't beat me because you
took off to do important human </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rights things. I respect
you because you did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - What's going on? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - Isn't one of the antagonists,
like Mohammed Ali's son. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - But like respect to Mohammed Ali. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But even though he's weaker
than him, because he went to, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he took time about his career
to, to argue for civil rights. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Great. We love the guy, but
then junior is just like cocky. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then he gets like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But then he like kidnaps, like the main, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like loving just the pocket
and then gets beaten up by like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> five dudes for five days straight, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just like over and over and over. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> There was also the scene I
love where it's like, honey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm a coder. Who's like
my favorite character. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, he he's like bored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So he's just like, oh
man, everyone's a week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone's way. No one can
stand up to me except one man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> call my manager, you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going to go pay him a visit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So he goes and pays him a visit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like walking down
the street. And he's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we gonna stop fighting.
And he's like, right here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, yeah, that's
in the middle of a crowd. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then a kid comes up and
is like, oh my God, you draw. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm a massive fan of you. And
like handsome, like a squishy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> right? It's like, can
you sign this squishy? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, normally you
think he pulls out a pen? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Does the sign? No, this is a humble user. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> He's built different.
What he does is he stab, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he gets his finger. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> He stabs the Shishi and then
slices it into four quarters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with his finger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's like all broken
apart. And the kid's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my God, thank you so much, honey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Avocado is like, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I'd be happier with that than a signature. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, what is this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they start beating
the out of each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is insane. Like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I I'm sure if you don't
know anything about Becky, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that probably sat me no sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it doesn't make any sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Don't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Don't in context. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I still don't quite
understand what the story is. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I've watched three seasons.
I don't get the point of. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You watched the Netflix and
that's six seasons on even the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> beginning of the story. Cause
Netflix seasons are like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Starts a season. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like a. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Sequel to an anime or like
the Mongo that came out like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> decades ago. And then it's
been going along with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. GI has gotten a lot better as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> On the season. The CGI has kind
of jank in the first season. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think still watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, I, I would
say like the animation, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> especially compared to
Joe, Joe isn't as good, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> but like you don't watch
it for the animation. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You watch it for like the bat crazy stuff. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's just like, it's just
insane how they decide fights. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And it is like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> imagine if a world was decided
purely by muscles, like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's like muscles can
solve every world issue </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in the world. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh God guns in this world
are meaningless compared to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> muscles like guns don't do
any guns or suggest guns for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> normal human beings. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> And they don't operate in the
same world for the characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> too. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like every single
character is an Avengers level of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> threats. That's just what,
that's just what it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And it's every single time
you think you've met the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> strongest character? No, they, he, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they introduce some new character
that is even stronger as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the main. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - One in the pile to Regan. Is it the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Prehistoric guy? Is it the first human? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, sir. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I believe they've done what
they did with the first season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up. They sent me one
season split into two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's what we've done here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the first arc is
just through the prison. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> And then the next doc is the,
prehistorical the pickle. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> This, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> this arc opens up with a press
conference from like a safari </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> where like all these people
died to this giant mammoth. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Elephant, which killed
hundreds of people and, and, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and animals. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And in this press conference,
he's like one man killed this, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> this 500 meter tall. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, and then like the press
conference was like, no, no, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> no it didn't. And then
it's like, what is this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What is so dumb? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's what I love about Bucky
is that every character has </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> such as this bat crazy backstory, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> the way they get introduced
with this like crazy backstory. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And you have like Speedwagon, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> like basically a narrator just
going over their entire bags </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> with him, doing all of these
like batshit crazy things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> And you think he can't
get crazier until it does. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Every time. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I've almost caught off to
the manga. And I'm like, how, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> how did they top the first
human ever who ever lived? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Who beat a Tyrannosaurus? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> even though I know sort of what
the next doctor about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is an arc about them
fighting prehistoric creatures, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a lot of what the. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - And they're like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> let's see if they stand up to the humans. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Today, like Jurassic park instead, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> if they turned into test the humans, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> instead of like seeing what
the dinosaurs could do, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> let's see what the humans
can do against the dinosaurs </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> because humans, humans are
too boring in this world. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Cause it's just like every, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> no normal martial arts master
is good enough anymore now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But it's just so funny because
like the main protagonist, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> which is the main character, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> his dad is just like bat
insane. And also just hilarious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just so insane. Some
of the he's actually insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The fact there's a whole
whole scene dedicated to him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching his son having sex. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that was, that was
what sold me on the first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Honestly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I can't sell you on Becky is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> there is a scene where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he is about to lose his virginity. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And his dad comes in giving him
advice in like the creepiest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then he was like, Louis,
please watch this show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It is insane. The fact that
people haven't watched, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is just mindblowing. He. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally squats down next
to the bed and says, eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Her, Every day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every day. And see your instincts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let your instincts take
over. Become an animal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bucky tons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Super sand levels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - He loses a genius. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They have, they have like a, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> because like they actually have
sex and they turned the sex </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> scene into what Jo Jo fights like, oh, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sex sex is like a bat. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm a, be honest though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is in real life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> You like trying to think
of like 10 things of this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Make sure you do it right. Accurate, sexy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> The enemy changed my mind.
No on top of that, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Not only is the, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> is this the hyper sexy anatomy
immediately after that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You don't need this. No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Goku super say, and I'm
going to save the world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This man powered up more than
GOCO ever wishes. He could, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> by losing his virginity. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> These people can sense that
this man lost his virginity. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> They did. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He was fighting. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because one of the prison
guys like trusted, come. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - On. No, no, no, not one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two before this main character
was so weak that he couldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> face one of these dudes
one-on-one after sex. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Two of them come in and they
cannot face it like this man's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aura. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This man's Nan has increased
so much from busting a nut. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like they can't even think
of some that develop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like hockey power. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then it's like gone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> turned into his dad after nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's insane. But it's this
whole episode was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> you had to pause it and just
be like, what the is going on? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Please watch back. It is insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I cannot add this new season was so fun. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was going to only watch like
two episodes have binged it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all in one day. So fun. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's insane to watch it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> If you go into the mindset of
this is going to be a kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stupid Jojo esque show. I
guarantee you will love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> If you can watch it with
the boys, the is hilarious. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - We need a Bucky out of
context and a compilation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of barking. So many out of context, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Jo Jo memes and compilations, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but there's nothing for Bucky now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't, I don't it's it
deserves like it's just every, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can think of so many clubs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many clips of this show
that could deserve to be being, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my Lord. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fight for my life about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Going back to the gym though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like how you watch
this when you're doing the gym. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like the last thing
I tried watching anime while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> going to the gym. Cause I'm
just like, yeah, dubbed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, do you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get too absorbed into
whatever you're watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I can't like, I can't
concentrate on like working out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If I'm like absorbed into a show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right here. I want to get absorbed </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in anything but running. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I want to take my mind
off. Cause the moment I, I, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I want to be staring at my
screen and not at that calorie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> counter or the distance treadmill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bike is like, perfect. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like is amazing
because you can just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you have something
that's like an hour 30, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just go and watch. Like if you're, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> if you want to watch something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I will do my best to just be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to watch this just on the bike. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I, you know, I, to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the viewing experience is
nearly identical. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not as good. And
you're not as comfortable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not going to say it's the
same thing. But you know, if, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> if it's something that you
don't care about too much, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, it's not that one
film you've been waiting for. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause like every time I've
watched something while trying to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> work out. Cause I remember I, when, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I still went to the gym. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was always watching
YouTube or watching. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - YouTube videos and stuff. I think, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I feel like YouTube is fine, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but like with anime I tried
watching like the new season of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> my hair, academia, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I used to do Bosch and I
realized I would watch an episode </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then I would not retain
anything that happened in that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> episode. I watch watch the
next episode and I would like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'd be so confused as
to what was going on. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh wow. Okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> See, I can normally follow along. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I mean, because I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're doing your
you're working out, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. You're working out
for, you're doing the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the sets for like what
a minute, minute, half, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> two minutes someone's gonna call me, like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> you're doing it all wrong. What the? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> But like, you know, you get,
you get on and off time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I normally just, I have it
down below, like on the floor. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I do my through my reps and
I just kind of watch like one </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> minute and America next rep
and then set it, tell me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I, I can't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> Like if I'm doing reps, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> like I need to be like fully
concentrated. I need to, like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You said, it is really
hard to, to focus. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> When the, tell me about this GPS, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> he's like laughing too much to do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bucky would be impossible to watch at. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The gym like that. All them, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> the most muscular men on earth
talking about like the insane </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> amount of strength and muscles. They have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doing a squat while someone
is talking about how they gain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> their muscles. And backy is
like the most like pumped thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you, can't not go for
the extra wrap, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's insane. I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I, yeah, it is, it
is kind of difficult. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You kind of have to pick and choose. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Now in my head, I have
like media for the gym. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, this is gym media. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This is stuff that I can watch in the gym. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Cause I don't care too much about it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I want to watch it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> And if I, if I care a lot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll stop watching it after
one episode and save it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> I like it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And I'll save it for
when I want to watch it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - If not the secret to getting
Connor, to watch anime, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> going to the gym. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically getting me
to do something right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Maybe not watch, but
obviously right now I've, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I've not been watching anything at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been just watching
league of legends, but. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's kind of. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hard. I'm very tired today. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I had four hours of sleep
because I've been watching league </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> of legends. Pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I would talk about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know Joey's not interested
in the toilet quickly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but basically it's been one
of the most hypers years in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> group stages, every fight every year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well the harvest, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> the legends is probably the
only sport I try to keep up with </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> or at least for the worlds,
it is really entertaining. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> And I'm sure. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm sure if I understood the rules, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think I'd really get into it as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I like watching e-sports stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but what I actually enjoy about
worlds specifically, well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> does that you get, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get the same feeling from
worlds as I get watching, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like say the world cup
or something, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where like, even, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> even in the smallest stages
you have like really small </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> regions and you have like
regions that are like across the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> world. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> And even though you have like
certain countries and certain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> regions that are stronger
than others. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Like it's still feels like a
global event where you see fans </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> from all over the world.
Especially when we had a crowds, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> just like cheering for even
like teams that are not so </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> well-known that are like
up and coming regions. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And I really like, I love that
in sporting events when it's, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> when it's not just like
one kind of country, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's like a global kind of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, but that's what I mean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. It's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like league for me would
be like any other sport that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just don't know the rules of. Like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like once you teach
me the rules of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's going on, like how, how, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what's a good play. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's not a problem is you need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to let them to play league. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. But I don't want to
do that a hundred percent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> You don't want it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like, you know, it's like, again, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> like learning any sport, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like once you know
the rules, I think it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you can have a really fun
time of just watching it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching it and playing
it. It's totally different. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the reason I got
into league as these players, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as opposed to like, maybe like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember trying to get into
the Overwatch e-sports scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me. And oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like the game of sides, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which I don't think is as good
of a spectator sport as say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> league or something. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I remember I went
to an event with our, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with our mates and I found out
that they had teams from like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> different cities from
across the world. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was really upset. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were like, oh my God,
they have a team from London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember what the
exact name, what Spitfire, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> London Spitfire team
from London, Spitfire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> We've got some representation
from the UK and London. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember the team walks
out and everyone is Korean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, why
would you lie to me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - To me? Like they confused. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I understand it. But it's
like a franchise model. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. It's kind of like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like football teams where you
sell the slot to whoever does </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it. But. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - They had, there was no London who was. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Not a single Londoner. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - To my nose. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> The way the Overwatch had
done it is that they had these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> team names decided you could
buy in and you getting, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know if you
could choose, but yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It kind of ruined it because
you know, as much as you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, league of legends has so many, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're allowed to bring
in foreign imports. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So there's like a maximum
cap to how many people you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> import from other countries. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - If you're rooting for Europe. Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'd like to see Europe. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a Japanese rugby
team at one point with a less </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Japanese place than. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> And this year in league, like the Jew, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> there was a Japanese team that
qualified for the main event. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's the first time I
ever have in history because no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> one in Japan who gives a
about league of legends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> So it's just like really small
team quantified for the main </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> event. And I'm just like, it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This is the plot line
right here. What the? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> Why am I watching animated. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Strong Neesha? But I just struggles. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause there's not a big
PC culture. Hell no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Unfortunately I don't really
see a PC culture taking off any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> time soon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's crawling, but it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think it's like
dedicated to games likely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I think it's just mobile
gaming is just too massive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For like people, because as
we said, people don't have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like stuff like apex is blowing up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think that's been
a real big push for PCC </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Apex is doing very well in vitro, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's only just especially,
at least in Japan very much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I think before that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like the biggest PC game
we had here was like pub G. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> But, and like that was like
the biggest in the dirt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I think that was like the
biggest that I'd ever gotten </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in Japan in terms of like a PC game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - PC, like bangs are
popping up a bit in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> They are a. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - PC cafe gaming cafes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Chill because we have it in London, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> but that was one and it
was so God expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like $15 an hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. And it was it's like,
it's it's I understand that you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, you're a business, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you got to make money and
London real estate isn't cheap. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> But also it has to come on. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> There's gotta be a reasonable
amount. I've got a PC at home, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> come on like five bucks
an hour. I'll buy food. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> I'll promise. I'll buy food. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> You know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I, I don't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a bit of a rip bit too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Much because yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> If I want to have a full gaming
session with the boys in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cafe, I spent like a hundred bucks, bro. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but if I want to play the
entire steam library for that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. What if I want to play
like a game of like SIF two, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> which is like 12 hours was rip,
then it's like $300 for GSE. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, what the? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I think in countries like Korea, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a lot more affordable
because they rely more on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you buying food and drinks and stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I would prefer I'll
buy food and drink. If. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Cause I feel like in
the UK it's like, it's, it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a strange concept. You
know where it is in Korea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just a normal way to socialize. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I noticed that in Korea,
it was not Korea in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> It was either Chinese students who, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in that old day where it was
kind of like British people, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> who'd be like, Ooh, play PC for an hour. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ooh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - It wasn't meant to, unless
you're a rich foreign student, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're supposed to be there all day. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a shame because I
would love to game in a PC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why, that's why we want to go to Korea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've been saying this before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we've always just wanted
to spend like 12 hours a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gaming. And that's my idea of a vacation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds like an amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Vacation to me. Shut off my phone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just game. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Look at me game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just get some toxic
gaming in there because I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I realized how like small, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like how unpopular PC gaming
was in Japan when Nazi joins </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the Japanese league of legends
servers. And I was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> great. Join the Japanese
league of legends service. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Perfect way to practice my
Japanese and game at the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> time. A little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> I realize until like about
like 50 games in no one on the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Japanese league of legends
service speaks Japanese. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> No it's all Chinese. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Everyone speaks Chinese or
English because no one Japanese </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> is playing the Japanese service. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like Chinese Giannis. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People were smurfing
on the Chinese people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just go to like have fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And what I realized is that
it's the most toxic server in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the world that I've been to
because no one Japaneses play. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's all smells from
other countries. Just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> let's just like being toxic on the server. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> So yeah. I can see why
Japanese, like it's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially with league, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> at least why it wasn't
so popular in Japan. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Apex is a different deal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> but basically the secret to
getting a game popular in Japan, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess it's just your appeal to beat you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Just put some gotcha. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Gotcha. Put some gotcha in
league and you're all good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You got the Japanese market. Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a conceptual game as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> It's very easy to hop in
and just play a few games. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> If you ever guys one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one day I saw you playing
Minecraft the other day now I'm so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> disappoint. You started without me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I was invited. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - To suffer boys. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I saw you dying in the
lava like five times. Listen, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> we don't talk about it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> We'll play Minecraft. Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I've got to get myself situated first. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I've recently just
moved as well. It was a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what are your places? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Goodie was an interesting
moving experience mostly because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of all the that Sydney has
built up over the years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. So we hired the same
moving company, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, so there's this main guy
and he knows that where YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was. Cause he moved,
he moved all the trash, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the trash day stuff. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't think he was prepared. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like he knew that we
were anime fans. Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> But I don't think he was prepared
for some of the stuff that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sydney had. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Like just within her closet. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I remember. So yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Before, before, so before,
before they do the move, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> they also have to like scout
the place just to see what they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to move and how many
trucks have to rent out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And Sydney, Sydney was
just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know the stuff, I
know my room's a bit of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a bit of a nuclear like
wasteland right now. You know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to clean it up a bit. Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So what she does is she takes
off all like the lewd posters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> off a wall, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She's like, I'm going to,
I'm cleaning up my room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, he's not going
to notice cleaning up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cleaning up my room. So she
takes off all the loo posters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank you. She's got a job done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got nothing to worry about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What she forgets right. Is
there's no posters on the wall, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's just a massive
pile of sex toys that she just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> somehow forgot about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You really know how numb she
is to that kind of where it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like, oh yeah, there's
nothing wrong with that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> It's the of the round sign art, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Then it's the 10 kilogram boobs
that are just lying on the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> floor. So she forgets to hide
that, but she takes softer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slightly lewd posters off the wall. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Distasteful gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now the guy opens the door
and is greeted by just the 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kilogram boobs that are just
sitting on her desk that she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somehow just forgets about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> He probably wanted to like
get out of there. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'll figure after we
get everything packed up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously he like, they
hired different people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So he he's seen all this before, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but obviously his employees
haven't seen this. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so they have to, they
have to pack everything up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. And so how it was,
they packed everything up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> There were about like
four men just loading, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> loading stuff into the
two trucks that we had. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Sydney stayed behind. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> Sydney, stayed behind to clean
up a place after we had all, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> we were all driving to our new
place to unpack everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And I sat with them in one of
the vans and I sat with them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with two of them. And two of
them weren't the main guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was just one of their
employees. And it was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like a good 15,
20 minutes of silence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were just driving along
and the guy next to me just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> goes so interesting stuff. He got there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like, I'm starting to explain the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. So it's like, you
know, this is just, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where you tubers and the room
that, that room, that room, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, that room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's not my room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like trying to explain
what b-boy is unfortunate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right. It's like, ah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So there's a little up sheet
here, but don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's totally fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I showed them all the cost
plays I had. They were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what, why do you have so many costumes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is there so many dresses?
You're like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's my job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's worse to say if it's
your job or if it's your hobby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The guy walked in my room
was like, so you're single. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad Sydney was there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause if it was just me sorting
this out, like I kind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do I explain that?
How the do I explain that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> So yeah. I live, I live with a fiance. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know she collects sex toys
and reviews them on a YouTube </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> channel. And they'll
just like, yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Review. I was like, yeah, sure, bet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Bet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not even the worst
part because after, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> after I have this like a half
an hour explanation explains </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to them what we did and
just, you know, just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> just explain the situation
so they understand. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> So we get to the house and
so they start loading stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> first goes the beds and then
all of like the other boxes and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> then the big stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> And then I had scheduled the
gas guy to come on the same day </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because you know, we've got to
turn on the gas or maximize, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, midmaxing, midmaxing moving. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Yep. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> So I got a phone call from
the gas guy, as every, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as everyone's coming in, packing, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> unloading all the stuff into
the house, I'm like, oh, I'm, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm about to come over. Is that cool? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, great, perfect. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm here right now. Just come right in. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So he comes in checks,
the gas thing turns it on. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Does the check everything's
perfect. And as he's, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> as he's about to walk down the
stairs, guess what pops up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the 10 kilogram boobs
right in front of him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The guy just like presents where
I'm on a silver platter and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Inside of like a box or anything like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That. He was, he was inside
a box, the box, the packaging, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> which is just an anime girl
with her breast cell. Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because this thing, this thing
doesn't need to go in a box. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It is its own box. It's just boobs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is 10 kilograms. The
box is big enough by itself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So he just, he stops. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They both stop. The gas guy looks at him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It looks at him, looks down at the box. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It looks at me and he
goes, oh, very important. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - So he's like, yes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's got a sense of humor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - The guy. So what is the guy
was like, oh, a one of them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I'm just, I just
phoned Sydney up afterwards. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, why did, why
did you give me this job? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I should be the one cleaning up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You should be the one handling with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really necessary to keep. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I also didn't need to go in
the box that had all the loose </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in front of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you couldn't have just put
it into like the moving box. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I, we let the movers pack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What I did with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - All my loose is that I packed it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a box separately before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the moving people came. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they had no idea of all
the coasts should I have in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I try to pack as much stuff as I could, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's too much stuff
because when they pack stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I just lost track of
everything. I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know which box everything's in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I tried to like help them
and like try to keep track of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything. And then like
about two hours in you realize, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know where anything is anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And, and so like, even like
a month after I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> which box is that one specific
thing I need in, I terrible. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> The boxes can't find
it. And I'm like, well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I still haven't found
my wireless headphones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is somewhere in one of the boxes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I like you forget about the
little items that you kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> need in day-to-day life until
you're staring at about 20 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> boxes in front of you. And
you realize that, oh, this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this one thing is in one
of these boxes. Like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess how does that
happen? Every time I've sweat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I, it doesn't matter who I ask, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how far they're moving,
how much stuff they have, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> every move items. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just like go into some Donnie
Darko happens where it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like disappears into a
void on the way it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause like you, you look at it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I had that as well
where I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm missing like two or three items. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At least I went back to the old house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously not there ring
up the moving company. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They say they don't have
it. I'm like, well the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where the did it go? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're not going to tell me
it's in one of these boxes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you opened it all
up and still not there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What do I do with it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I miss moving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As a student, you just
had like two suitcases. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just Chuck, everything
away, you don't need. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The thing is when you're moving, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you have like an apartment stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you just forget how much is
hidden. So, so you panic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Such a nightmare. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pack the big. And you're
like, oh, I'm like 80% done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then somehow you add another
three hours of packing on top </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that because there's such so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just accumulated random. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was surprised how
much was in my kitchen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My kitchen is like two boxes, three boxes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It was like 15 boxes. Just kitchen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, how is this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Why do I own so many spoons
and plates? What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know. I owned that much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I have like four different
types of plates. I don't, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I already use one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because he like go deep
into like Cubs that you open. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Like once every like couple
months. And he's like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I didn't realize I had 17
bottles of dishwashing liquid. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Just like sitting back there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Dude, man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> getting rid of all the
cardboard after moving was so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dumb. Don't talk to me about that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - 18,000. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I probably had a Japanese
forest worth of cardboard in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> apartment. At one point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was, we ordered, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they took all the cardboard
with them cause they unpacked it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> all for us. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Don pocket. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Doesn't that service cost like 10 grand, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but we were sponsored. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nice. Nice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For some nice. For some, I just. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just can't in good faith. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Pay 10 grand for them to move my stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I didn't get sponsored
by it, I wouldn't have paid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For it. Just like the one
that they charged me, like two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I think to rent, which I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, that makes sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess it's a full day
of work. It's a full tank. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a truck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You thrown away stuff to
get. That makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It makes it somewhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So they got to make a profit
man, but cycling out here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I saw your moving company. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> Someone was moving into my
building and it was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the whole place had been
like taken over by them. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> There was like 15 of them on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The elevator. And like
the outside is like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - No wonder they cost like 10 grand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They they've got the whole
dark Japanese workforce here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> doing this stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They really they're really
all like, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess they're really
prideful of they company or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> something. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But like they love plastering
their logo all over the, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it seemed like a. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it seems like
a military operation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> let's see from the anime where
they call the SDF like, oh, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> get the STF down here, man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> This the, this is a real job. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - I understand, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If you've got a family, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> you've got kids and and
you're doing pretty well for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> yourself. I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I trying to move with my
kids. Like I would like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I would not want to be in my
situation that I was in plus </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> kids. I understand that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like, yeah, just bring in the SAS, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> bring in the Marines, bring
in John senior that do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Like I do not want. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - Especially if you were,
you know, like, you know, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> in your 60 seventies,
it's like, you just do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I guess as you
get older, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you won't be moving
nearly as often. You know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I still don't know if I'm
going to move into a years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four years, but it, once I'm like 40, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm probably going to be staying
there for a good amount of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Wow. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That is a late time to settle. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Down anytime soon you kidding me, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> but I get you unless I become
a billionaire hedge fund, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> then I'll just buy 15 properties, live 11, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> whichever suite I want to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Private jet. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's my one day these
stocks are going to turn green. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> And I tell you, man, I tell you that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't settle down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> If you're settled in five
different countries, same time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> great. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Big brain. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - I I'm still going through
that phase where I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm in my thirties now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> I should probably think about
where I want to settle down. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But just like, that's just like. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - I feel like settling down
is when your, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> when you're stopped, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> when you're working in a place
that you feel like it's going </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> to be your end. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think I'm going
live in Japan forever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't speak the language. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> And even if I did, I'm like what? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I want to raise a kid here. Probably not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. There's like a lot of, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there's a lot of different
factors that go into like my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> longterm sediment, like where
would want to settle down? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I do like Asian culture and you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do like live in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> but a big thing about Asia is
that I don't want my kids to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> go to school here because my God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they put so much pressure on
exams and schooling here that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like this, this is too much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is too much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I saw a post on
Facebook. Like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Japan per capita has like the
least exams of any country. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it was like before
high school, I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh that's great. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So just let them be happy until
age 12 and then just them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - They're really happy. And it's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> give them heaven for about 12
years and then give them hell </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for the next three. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That makes so much sense </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because Japanese kids like so cute. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You like whenever you see
school kids, they're so nice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Say hello. You know, they, they just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just so inquisitive
and everything. And then like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you start some of these, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's before they learn like a flip. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I swear like every Japanese
teenager goes through the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> same moody teenager phase.
Like it's, it's like, there, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there is no exception. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm telling my kids get cocky when they, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> when racism is the same as it is. Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like it's cause like,
cause I can tell like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> cause you know, sometimes
with Japanese kids, right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just from looking at them,
you don't know how old these, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of these kids are.
Like, there are some like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> ten-year-olds that look 30 and
there are some 30 year olds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that look tan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But like you can always tell though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> when it's like a middle school, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Japanese kid and a high
school, Japanese kid. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> No, from the looks, but from the attitude, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> how happy they are. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - How happy they. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Are. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And just from the attitude towards how, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I guess they like talk to foreigners, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I guess in a sense like. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - High school students are very
scared of talking. They are. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But middle school and
like elementary school, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Japanese kids love talking to. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Children. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - In the street. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Not going around, going
like hello to every child. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - But yeah, in my old,
my old apartment block, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the only people who would
ever like converse with me, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> I like the little kids whenever
I get stuck in the lift and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, oh, what's the
word you want to go to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> Where'd you come from? I'm just like, oh. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm talking to, and then some,
I don't know what happened. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Something in high school
happens where they just suddenly </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> become paranoid of foreigners. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Life. Like just they ruin their life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. And then with the
expectation, but you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you also know which high
school student dropped out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> because they're very happy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They're like, how are you? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Yes. I'm not in school anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Doing really good for
myself. Thank you very much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't have to go through 17 exams a year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just wouldn't want my kid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going through the system again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Also if Japanese banks
are like this, God knows, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> God knows what the rules are
like with Japanese schools. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my lowest being a parent.
Having to deal with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think though it depends
heavily on the score that you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> to. Like obviously, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> like I think public schools
definitely have it the worst. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's the same
with any country out there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you know, if you go to, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> if you take your kid to like
a private school or even an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> international school, like
I think it gets a little. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bit better. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Totally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, I don't plan on
having kids anytime soon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. I mean either that's the
problem for like future me to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Out the trash tastes episode 5,000 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 5,000 kid. himself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Am I right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you relate? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I went fishing this weekend. I know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I know we were talking about
our trash chase fishing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> special. I'm sorry guys. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Lynn Malin was one who invited me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I blame, I blame Merlin. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Trusted you. Melaine. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - Malin. Just invited us, me and Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> If we wanted to have like a kind of kind, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> kinda like a double day where
we go fishing together and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> I've really enjoyed. It
looked like you were. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Enjoying it. Like you were
about to shoot your shot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah. So like, okay, so this is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> so this is the first time
where I went sea fishing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> So it wasn't like it wasn't a
fishing in a river or a lake, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which I've done before on a
boat before. So, so it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> it is an entirely different
experience, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Mostly because I've never been
seasick in my life. Right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were talking about this. So on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> on the journey up there,
everyone's like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> does anyone here get seasick? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> Which is if you get seasick
and you're about to go fishing </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> on the sea pro probably
a bad idea at time. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But none of us had ever
been seasick before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we're like great
fishing on and see easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> What we didn't realize is what
I didn't realize is that when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're actively doing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> doing things and having to
concentrate things on top of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being on the sea and being
on the edge of a boat, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it like amps up your sea sickness to 10. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> So this is the first time I'd
ever felt queasy on a boat. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I mean the, the entire thing was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> aside from having to deal
with the sea sickness, it was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was pretty fun. So what happened is we, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> we went down to Yokohama and
we went to the port there. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And so we are the, we have, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> they have this package where
you basically go out to sea for </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> about four hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was like, yeah, about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about four seven at a
time, these amount of time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And basically whatever you catch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can keep and you can do
whatever you want with the fish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So back when I went
fishing in Wisconsin, we, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever we caught, we could
only keep a certain amount, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but here you can like keep
whatever you want and you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> cook them afterwards as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we went out to see, and
I remember at the beginning, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it was me, Sydney Malin and marquee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right. And so obviously
he was our first time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So the fishermen was trying
to teach us how it was done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And within the first hour
Maillian catches too immediately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Right. And, and she's, she's just, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> she's just on fire right now.
She's like, I'm a natural, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm a natural. Imagine how smart she was. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So smug didn't catch anything
for the rest of the trip. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and like, and like on the
opposite side of things, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> which was Sydney and while Malin
was like catching her first </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> two with a now city, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he was like struggling to get
like the real town. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, like the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the fishermen was like next to
her for like a full-on hour, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like explaining to her then
explained to her again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, like here, he
was like Eagle lied on her, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just try and try to make sure
that she was doing everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> correctly because she was
not getting any catches. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then somehow like offer an hour in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She just starts reeling and
fished. Like it's no business. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She starts catching like four
or five fish at the end of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Once the controller finally play the game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then there's McKee, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which Paul Guy who's made in
his husband McKee poor guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> courts. I think, I think he
caught like one fish at the end. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so did I? No, actually
I caught like three or four, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but most of them were two big
different. The one I caught, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I caught one fish that I could
keep and the rest were just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like too small to even be worth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because stabs and because marquee
unfortunately was like way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> too seasick to be able to
function for most of the trip, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> which is the thing, which
is the thing where Malin, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Malin also was seasick.
And so aside to be fair, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Malin being Malin was didn't
want to admit it. Cause she, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> she, she was, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> she was like really silent
after about an hour, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> she was just sitting
down and I was like, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're right. And she was like, yep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yep. I'm cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just, I'm just,
just a little bit tired, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a little bit tired. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She told me afterwards that
she just didn't want to admit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> she was sea sick in case like
you, Cindy would be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh no little baby on one of
your medicine for seasickness, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which we totally would have done anyway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But as soon as soon as Marcie
mentioned that he was feeling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> seasick, she turns to me
and Cindy was like, Marquis, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> seasick. She sees sick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm taking care of Marquis. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Wow. I'm like, wow, what an. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like, I'm seasick as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, obviously I'm
not, I, you know, it's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's normal to get season
just like the blinking light. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> But it was so funny. Cause McKee
did a Markey's first catch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> He, he, he reeled in two
little, like super small fish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like baby fish. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like this big, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't do anything with them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like at this point
you just catch and release </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was the first like baby
fish we caught on the day and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this was about two hours in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> And so he caught them and I was like, oh, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> look at the little baby
fish though. You know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> we should probably probably
release them. So we, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he takes the hook out and he starts like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he puts them back in the ocean
and they start swimming off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I know, I swear to God,
this thing is like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this is like a scene
from the Simpsons. Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Or you can see them swimming
off and Sydney in her little </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and her little, you know,
Sydney is just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> talks about a dog or it
talks about any animals. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> She's like go swim,
little baby swim, swim. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then as soon as she finishes
saying that out of nowhere, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> a seagull peers and just
dive bombs to fish out of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> water. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he'd said, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the four of us were just
standing there looking at this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> atrocity in silence. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has been restored. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh my God. But it was actually like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was actually like a
really fun experience. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've how much was it to go on the boat? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like about a hundred
dollars. So the person, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you could catch as
much fish as you want. And, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and afterwards, so you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you go catch the fish and afterwards you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they have different services so off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you can go to an area where
they can cook the fish or you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can go to an onset. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so there was this
onset that we went to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is perfect. Like if
you're fishing for four hours, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's surprisingly tired. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like way more fishing
on the sea is way more active </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> than doing lake fishing
or a river fishing. Right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Because you're, you're, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you're batting against the
current and your constantly like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's way more, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's way more active because I
don't know what they call it, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but they, they give you the,
you the like this little cage. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So you've got the bait, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> which is on the hook or the
next to the Bates is this little </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> cage where you basically
stuffing stuff in like fish, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like dead fishes or, oh,
is that what it's called? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, oh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's why it's called a chum bucket. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh my God. It makes so much sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Now camera's like just
mashed up fish. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So they gave us a chum bucket. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess I was struggling
to find the worst. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Describe this thing.
It's a chum bucket man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Discover SpongeBob. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we had a chum bucket. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And so we had to fill up
this cage full of charm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And the cage itself would
attract the fish school with the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> smell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And the bait itself would like
attract the fish to bite on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it. Unfortunately like the
chum would like disintegrate. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Well then like, you know, within
a good five, five minutes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So like every, every, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> every five minutes you'd
have to like put it down, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> pick it back up, put it
down and pick it back up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fill it out, fill it up again
and fill up the Chomper, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fill up the chum cage with more
chum from your chum buckets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And so it was actually like
way more of an accurate yes or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Ganson. Your favorite word is now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - You're going to be feeling </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> we're going to be hearing this a lot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And so it was a way more active. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It was way, way more active
than the other kind of fishing I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> experienced. So I was
actually pretty tired. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I, it was, I worked up a
good sweats and my God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the onset afterwards, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know how you know how
after a hard day's work or how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've done, like, you know,
after a hard day's work on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It catches one baby
fish, that was a hot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sweating up a storm getting again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I, I did catch one fish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I caught the biggest fish of the day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sydney caught the most fish,
but I caught the biggest fish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Tastiest though. Huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Was yours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The taste? Of course it was mine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Of course. What fish did you catch? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The tasty ones you have? Oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember the type of fish I had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I believe it was a sea fish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Do you remember the type of
fish that we were catching? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, that's not the cheap fish, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like the though, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the you put in the can,
but that's like the cheap, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like when you go to sushi places, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like the cheapest one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the white one, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. It's the cheapest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you cut it open, it's like really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really white with the silver outline. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like the blue with
like a little bit of yellow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the fish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe I'm totally wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They do have like different
services where you can catch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different types of fish,
but like the good fish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds cool. Let's do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. Next time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Next time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Because you go to this onset
and while you're in the onset </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and just chilling out
with the boys or whatever, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> they're preparing your fish, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So they take your fish and so they take, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> take your catch and they
feed it to you afterwards. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You said that, that just made me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I had the immediate image of
somebody coming out of that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Open your mouth open.
He comes here, which is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is great. I mean, what better? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What better splice can you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Monkfish in ruins scape. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That is a high level of fish or shark. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or something. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It wasn't high enough level. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can't catch it. The level. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of that fish. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can't catch different
types of fisheries, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but the best fish come
out at like 7:00 AM. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's like a 7:00 AM when I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd like to try fishing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fishing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's that's, that's
like after, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> five tries or something, that's
when you're like dedicated, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's one where you have like
your own fishing rods and all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, you're, you know, you're legit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When you got your own equipment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fishing order is just
one of those devices </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that I feel like is such a big investment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because of how knowing it is to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maintain that break. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Also like when you
get like super serious, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like different
roads for different fish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I learned that from tales of rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, one of the
short, when I'm fine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I'm 50 and I haven't decided the hobby, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I think as a white person, that
is the default hobby I have. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. I think when I get
to 50, we'll see that in. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Golf. Oh wait the suitcase. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm going to be like, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We'll see Bob have a
hobby by then. I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe I want my hobby. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A couple of streaming
when I'm 50, I'll be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll be like, let's get
my dentures and myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I, I can't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not that old guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who's like used to stream or escape a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - The guy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Tried to cancel. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> He's still streams. Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm pretty sure. I think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> So there's a future, man. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, maybe I'm already
like low in energy now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh man, you say that, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> but you stream more than me and Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like I'm really low on energy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but then you guys are
always don't sleep much. So. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think there's a difference
between law and energy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and con you know, not being. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like, I'm not low in energy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just can't be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Maybe, maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I, I can't tell if I'm learning, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I am alone and just. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Throw my kidney. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have to conserve my
energy for trash tastes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People think I talk a lot
and then no, it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can serve all my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all my like social energy
for trash tastes every week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And then not like I've reset every week. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hard work in this, in this show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Though, if I stream, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> then that's my work done for
the day because I can do it in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> the night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How do I have energy after I've
been working all day to also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stream, which is to me work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes you start streaming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you just kind of get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> energy. That's just streaming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just that sometimes it happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like sometimes I'm really
dreading. It's called. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - And extra for like,
literally it's like your gig. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> You're gaining the energy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're siphoning the energy
from social interaction. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For me, it's the opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I have a certain amount
of energy and I have to expel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that during the day. Basically. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I be it out. What do you bring out? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Have no more shooting.
They promise no more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just like gone, goes to the toilet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> And Sydney's like, are you
expelling your energy honey? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Yesterday, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Tony dropping me during my
energy expiration period. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - How else are the moving stuff going? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You kind of getting settled
in, is it you dreading. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's because this is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> it's a bit different now
because I lived in apartment and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this one's a house and it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> This was actually where I was
actually really lucky to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this house because the
previous owner has gotten a job </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> abroad. And so he was very
desperate to find a tenant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> So we got it out like a amazing
price. Cause we were like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> when we were looking for other
places, we were, we were, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we didn't even know if we
were going to move because I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> remember talking to you guys
because you both were moving, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> you wanted bigger places. And I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm actually really happy with my place. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I suppose, a good size. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was a good size. And I was just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm only going to move if I
can find like a decent enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> upgrade. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we saw other places which
for the budget that was set </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and nothing was really like,
nothing really standing out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Maybe I'll just stay for another year. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And then this was like the
last house that we looked up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the estate agent
was like, yeah, we have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we have one more on offer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's essentially we
saved the best for last. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so we looked at this house
and it was like twice the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> size of any other place they'd
shown us for the same price. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we're like, what the though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is there is a catch though, which is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what the
exact contract was called, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we only have it for
a maximum of two years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So that was the catch after the hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So after two years we have to get. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Our switches. If you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> get really settled in you really? Like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - When we were looking for
places for the trash taste office </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we, one of the
places we will consider, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if we talked
about this on camera, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> but one of the places we were
considering was exactly the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> same. The first place we found, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> it was like this like three
story house that was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> oh yeah, this is like, it
looks like a perfect space. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> But then we found out
that, oh yeah, it was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it was owned by an ex-pat
who was overseas now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> But he was like, I'm
coming back in two years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So you better get the out. But I. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Think this one's actually
better in the end. I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Definitely, definitely
better in the end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But like initially when we
were looking at new studios, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was one that we were
really happy with because it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like good price, good location. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So in the end, what,
what made you move there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Was it just cause the
like the house, the house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the location was
amazing. The house is amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And I was just like, I, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> I move on average every two years anyway. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> So like I do it as we just discussed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not one to settle down. So I. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mixing it up, you know, I like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I like getting as annoying
as it is. Like I do like it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Two years is a long time.
If you think about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to me at least three, two
years is like a long time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's something exciting
about upgrading a little bit as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been working hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This is a little bit of an
upgrade and give myself a pat on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> the back three times more
expensive than my old one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's because I didn't
know how I was going to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> financially when I moved here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, yeah, when I
first moved here, I had. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - One. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bedroom. I don't want. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, same here because
when I moved here, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney just didn't have a
career yet. So it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a lot of, it was on a
lot of, it was on me to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> well, she, she sh you know, she, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> she obviously paid for it
as well, but a lot of it, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> a lot of it was if it
rested on you, if like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> if Sydney falls through
and her YouTube career, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't take off, then all of
this is going to fall on me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's why I was like,
that's what I was thinking about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But now it's a lot more
comfortable. We can vote, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> share the costs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we were able to have
like a bigger budget, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but still not stupidly large. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, we just found a
nice, really nice house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then Sidney's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Career took off and
we went stupidly lost. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And my, my mind, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause we were living so far away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We had to say where we live
now. Kind of like, say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to go on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm just wondering it was. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was, we didn't live in the center. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It was very. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Far away, very far away. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> It's kind of was kind of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> and I also live really
far away from the station. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> So I felt like double damage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - For me. I lived literally
three minutes away from this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually had like the nicest insights. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> And then I lived like, ridiculous. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, I didn't. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> - Know, like halfway between two stations. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Remember. Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And so I had the really annoying
case of just like I'm 15 </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> minute walk to one station,
20 minutes to the author. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Which like, doesn't seem like a big deal. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But when you, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> some days when you have to go
back and forth multiple times, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it really felt dreadful. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And I just got to the
point where I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm doing well for myself. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just going to spend
the extra money just to get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> somewhere that's super close
and that I can focus more on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> work. Don't have to worry about traveling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like now I don't have to
worry too much about before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I always had to plan it
precisely when I was leaving the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> house because I had to, I had
to look what the train was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I had to make sure I was getting
the express train because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> it was so far away that you
could get an express train that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saves you quite a
significant amount of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And so normally commutes
for about an hour for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is quite a long time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> And did you have to really think, okay, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> what am I leaving the house? But now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> now I can just kind of be like, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I generally know what
time I need to leave. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I kinda liked the commute though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause like may currently I'm
also like just like travel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> distance for me, like to
the office, for example, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like pretty much the same as it was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not that much different. Time-wise, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> it's just in a different. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - I always complained about
it the most, because for me, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I definitely valued distance
from where I was going along. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really liked the commute
though for somebody because it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> puts my mind off of work
for even just having. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I liked it until a certain
point because commuting here was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> fine. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Commuting back is a
nightmare because like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I would always dread it. Right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Because commuting, I don't
mind staying on the train, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but when it's like, when
you're going back off, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> we finished filming trash
tastes normally like in London, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like the rush hour is from, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let's say five o'clock
till seven o'clock right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where it's like, the Chub is parks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> You're not getting a seat. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're like a sardine for some reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> the rush hour in Tokyo starts
from like four till like nine </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> 30 or nine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> No it doesn't, it doesn't name
it goes on until midnight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So, so like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like the commute back
was just like a nightmare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I would like dread it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So I would dread the
commute back every time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it was just normally
if I was in London, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would just wait out the
rush hour. But in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is no waiting of
the rush hour. You just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> you just got to deal with it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well, it depends. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Right? Because like some, like you said, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you don't mind the commute. That's good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I mean, very Opie for you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You can get a much bigger
place. Would you ever, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> you have a much better place than me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's, it's kinda like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I just, I hated commuting. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And to me I felt like I could
spend my time better and I did </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> want to spend my time differently,
like streaming, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Like an extra hour of
streaming is a big difference, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like a long way. So yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I think for me as well as, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like an hour commute
for me now is so much better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than what I first had
when I first moved here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> When I first moved here, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I lived in a place that was a
25 minute walk to the closest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> station I up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was like way out of
Tokyo kind of thing. So like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> commuting into Tokyo would
be like an hour and a half, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> two hours. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is the walk don't
get me wrong. It's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Walking is not the problem
it's walking in the summer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't always be what you'd
like you sometimes you have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to carry a bunch of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's where it really sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> - The have so glad that finally
I'm able to wear a sweater. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so nice. Now, like
speaking of whether the, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> where did autumn go? Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just, it just was
like tea for two days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he's like, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So you just turn into winter. It's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Always like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm so glad though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I can finally wear
some drip without dripping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's disgusting for like
the middle of September was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just like how Japan decided
that it was going to be hot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until it wasn't one day and
then it just decided it wasn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it went from 25 to 14 in one
day and it doesn't look like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> it's going back, but how does that happen? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Whether. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Japan has full seasons, everybody. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That's what they tell you. No. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It has a pain for six months, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> then mild discomfort for two
and then the restaurant. Okay. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess it's kind of,
it's kind of that right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One biggest thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going back to the house at one
biggest thing that I've had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> to go to get used to living in
the house is a living on the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ground floor. Now I've only
lived, I've only lived in Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's though I've only lived
in apartments in Japan before, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was like quite high
up in my old apartment. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So you know what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I could stand next to the
window and be pretty confident </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that no one was going to
Sue me. You know, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> especially, you know, when you sleep, you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes you just sleep
in boxes as, as, as you do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And sometimes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes you just out of the
shower and you don't dress </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly. You didn't get
dressed straight away, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you put on your boxes or whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> and you just walk around the apartment. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I, I kind of realized that
you can't do that in houses. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So our house has like
pretty big windows. Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so I have a shower put on
my boxes and so the bathroom </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> or my shower room and my
wardrobe is on different floors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Right. So finish some shower, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> go up to go up to my living
room and just, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> chilling, you know, before
I put on some clothes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go up Souk, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> go up to my window to like
admire the view as you do </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> sometimes just admire the
sunshine and ground floor, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> admire the pavement on the
first floor on the first floor. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Okay. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So a little elevation, a
little bit of direction, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> because sometimes when I
was on, when I was on the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was on the eighth floor,
back in my own apartment, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you just like, look
down, breathe in the sunshine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I thought I'd do the same routine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was just standing in my
window and then someone opens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> their, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone goes up to the balcony
to put out some clothes and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me and them meet high contacts. And I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I totally not used to this
because back then when you're in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> apartments, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I was used to just being by
the window and nobody could see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you because you're too high up to be seen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And then, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so we make eye contact and then
they immediately just close </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the close sliding door again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I realize I'm just
standing next to my window with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> my boxes out. And people
can very visibly see me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, was the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this person they were
like across the road. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So 10 minutes away, it's
like 10 minutes away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> So they had 4k definitions,
literally, literally Cohen 4k, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my God, if it was made
in, she would like be, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> she would have seen my nipples
and everything scarred for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> life there. I fallen right off the bat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> He's shock like a new place. So, so far. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Everybody liked him. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Nice. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Also another thing I had to go
back to my house by myself to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> pick up some stuff pretty
late at night. And it's, it's, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's pretty scary to go back. It's, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's creepy as to go in
the house. And I didn't, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I didn't realize that until I went in, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> because when you're in an
apartment, there are like lights, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like outside of your building, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> there are lights and our
people live next to you. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You go in this house and it's
just pitch black and you're </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> just by yourself. And
you're like, you know what? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I wasn't afraid of the dark
until I experienced this. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And I'm going to sound creepy
about an empty apartment. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Pitch-black there was something
really weird about the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> apartments. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like I can handle in an apartment
because the worst thing, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> if you, if something happens, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if like a murder is there
or a burglar is there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can scream and people
are people around too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's confidence in people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think, I think you like your
neighbors a little too much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. It's probably
just like a placebo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but tons of motorists in
Japan, but I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe it's a placebo, but it feels safer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It just feels, I don't dunno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like having a nightlight,
you know, it feels like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it feels like it's not too
far away from your front door, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> whereas in the house, you're
kind of just there by yourself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we, we have a detached house as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, so it feels like you're
just completely there isolated, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whereas in an apartment, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there there's the apartment
block where there's people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> outside sometimes going
in and out there's lights, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> even at nighttime. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I just, I dunno, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It just, it just feels like
you're a bit more isolated. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> It feels scarier. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I could see why people can't
get scared of ghosts now in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Japan, Because this is creepy as. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't want to talk about cars. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Like I've rinsed from the
comments last time they were like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> did you say, oh, when
I talked about garish, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> people were very angry that I
spoke about. I was like, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But then it was just one of those. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That was another one of
those times. I was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I wish I could like go write a
script on why I don't believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> in ghosts and why that
stupid didn't come back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Believe in ghosts. There was a, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a guy who made like a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he made a followup video
about us talking about cars, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically, really
basically saying my point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but eloquent and actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and actually explaining what
is this video called? It's by, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's his name? Dark Viper. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you've watched
his trash tastes a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's a speed runner. And while
he was speed running games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was just giving us amazingly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amazingly eloquent explanation
as to why people believe in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garrison, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why it's generally like a
coping thing and whatnot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah. You know, it's stuff
that I normally agree with, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's one of those things
that you can never change. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If someone believes in ghosts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd never going to
change their mind. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's like, but for me to
be like, I don't believe in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes people get offended
by that because they've never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experienced it. Even if
I did, I wouldn't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The thing is I've never experienced it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I still believe in
it because it's, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> It's, it's cool. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I understand that.
It's nice to believe in, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but it's just one of those
things that I'm just like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> maybe I'm just too boring. I don't know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> To me, it just doesn't make
sense to me, I believe. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But that's, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I didn't believe until I
experienced something and then I </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> did believe it. So. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. But again, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I always think there's a logical
explanation of everything. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I think there's, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> there's always an explanation
that might be boring. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Might not be immediately
obvious that can explain it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Every, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> every mystery ever in history
that's ever been solved as </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> turned out to be not magic. Right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's like. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, there's always,
there's always something like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> we just don't have the
capability to understand certain </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> things. And yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I guess the people use that
argument for, you can put that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> That could mean that we
don't ghost could be real. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we don't understand
that. We're like, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But everything else in our world
thus far as is proven to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the case, that stuff like
that doesn't tend to be wrong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I believe in like the
supernatural or the paranormal, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't believe in 99% of
the media that comes out that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> says like, here's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that I really despise, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> and this is one thing that I
absolutely hate about and which </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really leads me to feel strongly against. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> It is the whole industry
that's propped up around no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no exact ghost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, I. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't agree watching teller's spirit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Show predatory at times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It makes me just want to
like, just get rid of it all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just yeah, no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no one don't believe in
ghosts because if one person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> believes in ghosts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then there has to be someone
who then gets into believing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into ghost and then falls
down this whole rabbit hole. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Their husband dies. Someone
comes to him, tells me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll let you speak to your
husband for $50 an hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. That is, that
is, that is predatory. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's predatory. And that's
like, that's kind of different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just people taking
advantage of people who are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very vulnerable and very
just looking for answers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - But I believe there are
people out there who I wouldn't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> class as vulnerable, but
maybe gullible more, sorry. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, there's nothing bad happened to them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> There may be more likely to
believe this kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I suppose you can't argue
that they're not getting what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they want. They're paying for some, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's kind of what in my
eyes is, but I guess to them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well, maybe they'll ask
for, so I have friends, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> very good friends who go to
fortune tellers and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just flat out just do
not believe fortune tellers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't believe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In that shady deal. I just,
you know, I think there is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are a lot of questions
that would be a raise. Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> So you know how to read
fortunes then why don't, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> why are you not very fortunate? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> It's why are you not using
this to your ability? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> If you know, why. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you not own about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - 10 Points a Fortune's
able to be changed? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Is this something, you
know, and if not, why, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> why has God bespoke bestowed
you with this knowledge of </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> people and. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Why you're not using
it to your own advantage? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I just find that there are
so many questionable actions </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and ultimately it all comes
down to the fact that you're </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> charging money and you're
getting paid. Well. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I said, you'll, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you'll free to believe
in whatever the you want, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> as long as you don't
like extorting people. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I mean, when you, when you add, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you add money into
the mix, of course, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's going to get messy, especially, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially if you try to like
monetize this. And I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you want to give away a
fortune for free, go ahead. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, but like, I, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like claim that you have
some kind of special power or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but there's no way to prove
that it's there right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Whether you believe in ghosts or not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there is no tangible proof
for, or against for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I believe, I believe
in the supernatural, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I believe in supernatural
things, because to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I believe that at the moment
there is so much about the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> universe and the worlds
that even science context. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I believe that I'm, I'm near certain, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that alien species out there
exists that we have not been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> able to come across because
the university too big, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like the whole concept of
modern ghosts and the way that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we understand them, I think
is completely incorrect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But what is the cons? What
is the concept of modern NGOs? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like the idea that someone would die </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and they're just going to hang
around a place, haunting it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, are you serious? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> No, no, that's not good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I believe in it. No, no, God, no. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But it's also because like a
lot of like Shintoist belief, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> revolver. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right? I understand that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's why, that's why
I, you know, it's one of the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> it's very tough for me to argue again, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like I'm not prepared. I
think we got to talk about it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> I look at it enough, go watch this video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> This that's great. I don't know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like I, I just generally
am of a scientific mindset. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've I'm most of the time I
am generally favorable towards </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the science soft science. It's not like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't believe in like like
people who can read like star </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> signs and Gordian lines. I'm sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, if you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you presented some kind of
panel activity that we had, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we really sat down and we
really went through it and we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really started poking holes
in it, we could probably, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, debunk most things I'm sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And any of the stuff that is generally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you say it's unsolvable
or nothing to explain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's generally a massive
lack of information or not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> enough stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - But that's what I mean. Right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like, it's, it's a lot like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like UFO footage where it's
like, I believe in UFO's, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> but I don't believe in 99% of the world's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like a lot of the scandalous
stuff first, for sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because we know that they exist. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> There are tons of identities, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> objects where they'd done married. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But there are also a
lot of like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> haunted videos and like
paranormal activity, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> like videos and photos that are just like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> no matter how you look at it,
it's inexplainable becomes. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Such a and I, I think. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I feel like you just
hate the culture around it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> I really do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Rather than I hate the culture.
I never talk about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I'm just like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I believe in ghosts on that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hardly mentioned it because
it's just like, I believe in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I've seen it. I don't really like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like to talk about it. Cause
it's just, it's my experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right? It's just, it's just. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - You can't force
someone to believe in it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't want other
people to believe well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> like experience what I experienced. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's just my experience with. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It gets done personally,
but I will never be like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're a stupid person
for believing in that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And I'm not going to be like, how dare. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You guys? You guys have some
form of some belief in it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I would never be like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I think you guys are stupid
because you believe in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I personally, to me it feels dumb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. The idea of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I am completely fine with
people who don't believe in it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you know, they can't be helped. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. It's like you
haven't experienced it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Cause like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to me it's like the
opposite sense where yes, I, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I completely agree
that culture is very messy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's very, very sensationalized,
which I hate sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know? And I mean,
there's been so many, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like people who have debunked, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people who have monetized their staff, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how can you not know that
a lot of people are just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> predatory, but at the same time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I do believe there is a lot
of things that have not been </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> able to explain with current
science. And I think it's even, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's naive to not think
that there is something not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something more out there that
hasn't been explained yet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's so many,
there's so much about, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's so much, we don't understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We take for granted because
science has science has evolved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and progressed so much that we
forget how much we still do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Not understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - About. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just the unit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess like generally my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my thought process along that
is if we don't understand the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> situation and we don't have
the tools to get to explain it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think that a paranormal
explanation is the correct </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one because you know, we didn't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We didn't know what caused
like cholera for a long time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> you know, I'm sure at some
point they thought it was, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it was the devil. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's one of those
things where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> generally when we've come to
at least my belief is that when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just don't have the tools
or the knowledge of subsequent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> fields of physics or math to
understand certain things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But also most of the time it's
so minuscule what happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like if your door closed one
night and it was real spooky, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> why would anyone delve deep
into trying to disprove you your </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> door uncomfortably close.
It's called a draft. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Paranormal activity. Once I can see the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pressure differential between
one of us, it's a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like there is so many
things that are so not worth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> explaining generally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the that is spooky is
so not worth wasting time on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to figure out because
it's so little information that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we have. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not worth explaining
anyway. Well that's the problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> One more, one more time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I also do want to acknowledge
that there is, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the whole psychic stuff and all that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do understand that there
is a market that is pure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> entertainment. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right. I could go to a fortune teller. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They could tell me a bunch of nonsense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't believe what they said, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was fun to hear the
funny words and they tell me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I understand that's an angle
and I'm fine with that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like your funny hoods magic magic, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Thank you for telling me
that I'm going to be wealthy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I appreciate that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I'm also like going to here when I've, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've I've gone to a fortune
teller before. Cause I like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like to experience what kind
of generic way they're going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to tell me about my future. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I love to understand the way
that they're trying to do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But that's not of a place of
me generally believing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I do think that is kind of the bit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there are a lot of people out
there who really believe in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this stuff. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - I, I, I, my mom's one of
those people and I'm like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like sometimes a mum's
like tasted me to a fortune </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> teller and I'm like, mom,
again, I'm mom again, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> do you get the same spiel. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Every time? You know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> they say generic things that can apply. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - To anyone it's cold reading, cold, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> cold reading is a technique
is a psychological technique. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But that's the thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I have. I almost have an
appreciation for these psychics. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Not so much in the supernatural sense, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> but more on the psychological sense of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, like Darren brown is more along. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not, he always sees not psychic, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like just using the
faults of the human. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Psychology. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anyone who's good at that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would never claim to be psychic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They understand that it's
a lot more than that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause claiming the psychic
really undervalues what you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Magic brain thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do I do I believe in like
psychics and people who can cold </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> read and stuff like that? No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do I believe there are people
out there who can maybe sense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> some supernatural things? Yes I do. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's fair enough. I
mean, I mean, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Again, like gotten, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I have personal experience
of either ourselves. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Th this comes from
just my understanding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The brain is just so flawed
in many ways and that we, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, there's been like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know if someone gave an argument, this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw a comment that
was arguing about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was just like, if you
can't prove it's, what's the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the really horrible
argue method where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you can't prove it's not
real than it than it Israel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. And it's like, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You need the burden is
proving that it's real. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Not that it isn't. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - This is what I find the most
annoying about arguing the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> subject is that for some reason, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's on the burden to me to
prove that you don't have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> magical sixth sense. No. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Prove to me like concretely that you do. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - The people who say like, oh yes, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> proof is a synonym for
truth. It's like, no, it's. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Really not. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's the thing. That's, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there's no way to pressure right now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And that's why it's
we call believing it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But there's the so many things, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so many, like I'm trying. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - To argue a point here,
cut all your points here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's just so many
clips of people. You know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they go to people who are like, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can talk to the dead
or I can feel the dead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then they showed them
pictures of people who aren't dead </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the other two. And they're
like, Hey, they're not dead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're like, oh, well,
you know, it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this happens so many times. So it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at what point are we just
going to be like, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is just. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Literally everyone who
claims that they can do this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> somewhere and other, when they
put the test that they fail, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> like rarely, no one
ever passes these tests. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Why? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like most of the time, like most, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most of the people I've met
who have stories around this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's got nothing to do with
the sensationalized you see on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what also makes it
very difficult to have this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> discussion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People have their beliefs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> They're so strong in my beliefs
that they don't consider </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that they could have maybe
experienced something that wasn't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that more often than not, they never. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - And it was like arguing about
someone with their religion. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. Which is like, you
never, like it's, it's just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just a lose, lose argument. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Cause either you believe
in religion or you don't. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And according to the other
side, neither is right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Or. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - And herbal admitting our own
faults as human being. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's so many, like, you
know, you go to criminal cases, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's so many like trials
and stuff where my witness </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> testimony has been given and
they swear a hundred percent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> They have nothing to
lose by lying about this, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that they saw something happened
that turned out it didn't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> happen. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And the memory because memory
is so unreliable and feelings </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> are so unreliable. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And what you see is never
exactly what you remember it to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> be. This thing, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> we are so terribly inconsistent
as humans that I find it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hard to believe that one person
who experienced sank. So, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so wildly kind of outer worldly
and that we don't remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a worldly though. I
mean, there are big, there are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there are bigger mysteries
out there in the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's case by case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There are some times I've
heard stuff where I'm like, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's some things
I'm like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that just sounds like you had
an experience that I wouldn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> describe as like, that's
like a ghost thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you just had an experience
that isn't like a ghost or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> haunted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You felt something. And I
felt that was a youth thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think that was the
world, but you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like that's us. That's like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The youth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - As in, like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was in the same room with
you at the exact same time, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I would not have experienced
the same thing as you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it is entirely a thing
that is happening to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's, it's, it's a mental
thing that's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think it's the thing
that's in this physical world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or this material world or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I think it's something that
if you put two people in the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> same room and one of them is
having that kind of experience </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> and that you're things like when you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you went on that tour
or whatever, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like, if you go on
a tour and you, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> haunted house and why one
person feel things in one desk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think it's a ghost
choosing, Ooh, spooky on God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I it's. You are setting
your, your mind is capable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You believe that that could happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You are a person who is subset
susceptible to feeling that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could be haunted. So you
go into a place expecting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe I could be haunted,
I'm open to this idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Something happens. You feel something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you, your mind
is like haunted or. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I could argue with the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I could argue the
complete opposite, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I would. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Never, yeah, totally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Agree. No, no, because like you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you are going to the mentality
that this susceptible to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> believing in this thing, but
right on the opposite side of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> on the opposite side side of the fence, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you are someone who is so
adverse to this idea that you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> would, you just shutting it out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you would shut out
whatever experience, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if there wasn't experience,
if there was right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - You never know you might've
perhaps experienced a similar </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> paranormal thing in your
head. It's just like, oh, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> that just happened. That was a bit weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I brush it off possibly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that it's, it's really
tough because like you said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it did happen, I,
I would probably just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would probably think of a
logical conclusion as to why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that happens more often than not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I can adequately
explain what happened, where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well, the people around me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whether there was a noise
or something that happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can normally be like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - This whole, like, I guess, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> culture to be interesting about. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Right. It's that like, we don't know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like both sides don't know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And it's the conversation of the believer. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Most of the non believer
who is right. Who the knows. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - I want to talk about. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I think unfortunately there's
people who argue my side more </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> often than not argue the point
that people who believe the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> are dumb. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> And so it kind of makes
this really horrible. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Whole sensationalized. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's just, that's just
an image problem, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It is, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it is so much of an image
problem because so much of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> media around the supernatural
is like sensation. Especially, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially like with like Halloween, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you like TV is unfucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watchable and Halloween because
everything is like ghost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> specials, but that's why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. That's what I like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even though I wasn't, I wasn't
saying like, you're stupid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you believe the. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The last time we still got this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got like the comments
people were saying to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was some that were
like really rude about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, Connor's just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he just thinks everyone's
stupid. If they don't believe it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, no, they didn't say that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like, I personally, I
think that stuff to me is, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is dumb, but I would never be
like, you're a dumb person. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I believe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think the important
thing is that you like people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> recognize it is a belief and
people have experienced it as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> some people can believe different things, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you never want to make
them feel like they've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> discredited for reading. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's why we have
such a tough political climate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because for a long time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> all these really extreme
beliefs were like, no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's the
problem. As well as that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's really a difference
between people who have a belief </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like, this could be true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the people who
swear that it's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And like, like I'm one of
those people mixed together. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, and that's
where like the bad image comes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm definitely one of those
people who is the former where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, I believe this
could be a possibility. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I find it more fun personally
to think it in that sense, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm not going to come
out and say like go surreal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hundred percent, no counter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I'm not going to say that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can't prove ghosts are not real, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you can't prove go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have more enjoyment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate the argument. You can't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I personally have the
enjoyment of thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There is a possibility we just don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's what I find exciting
about believing in this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, for me, it's like,
it's, it's less of just, it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's less of just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is a fun thing for me to believe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's more of just like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's had different experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I've had like my own experience
as well. And I couldn't, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess, like, I couldn't
logically explain it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so what happened was well at, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at this moment with my
experiences and what I've seen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's more likely for me that it exists, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then it doesn't exist. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And am I open to the fact
that maybe what I experienced </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wasn't real and you know,
I'm open either way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but right now, based on my
experience, I'm just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I believe it. And that's
the thing I believe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. It's all about
whether, you know, cat facts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no printer. It's all about, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess like whether you're
just like naturally susceptible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to, I guess like believing in
things like spirituality and. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All that kind of stuff. It's
definitely is if you didn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Grow up with that side, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A little harder. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> It definitely comes to, I mean, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> everyone around me was
quite religious Christian or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Catholic, et cetera, et cetera. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I just, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think my probably probably
where I started to grow a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> disdain towards that stuff is
I just didn't enjoy it when I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was younger. Like I hated church. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I had all that stuff. Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when you get older and you've
discovered the internet, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're like, oh, I can do my own research. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then you start like Googling
stuff. And then I dunno, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I was very. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think it's entirely reflective
of how I view the world. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like I, you know, I guess like,
what's the meaning of life, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> rock boy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro. You got to bring that out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right now. Like why,
why, what are we, what is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what is our purpose, man? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What are we doing? Rick
and Morty it's too deep. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, you know the same
reason why, when I look at it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I look at a fish. What's
the, what's the fish doing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> What's the fish's purpose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To get getting my stomach exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Be eaten by someone else. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I sit here and I look
at like all these animals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just there to be
eaten, no to survive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think that in some
senses, we're just the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're not, we're not, we don't
have some grand purpose to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to have some spiritual
experience. It's just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're just here to, eat
and get on with our life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> If I want to play some league
of legends for 12 hours a day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that the universe has allowed
me because I've done my duty, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is survive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And now I can mentally destroy
my life really. But you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think once you've done, once
you've survived, that's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I believe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I believe they call that a nihilist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The problem is is that
now we just have, now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now survival is just, the
rules have changed, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You used to being a Sigma
male man. It's hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They've got to pay bills. man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I can't be Sigma mail
while I pay the bills. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Don't pay your bills. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Bills paid you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, I've done it
because that's, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't really believe there's a lot of, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a lot of going on in life. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I just kinda think that you
just kinda popped and you just, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just what you're doing. That's fine. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I wish that I could have some
more enjoyment out of it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but that's just not how I
feel. I don't know why, man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I wonder what made me feel that way. Well, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> how do you guys feel about it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just uncomfortable talking
about it. Yeah, yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I guess like, I don't
know, for me, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least with like the whole
ghost thing for me is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> obviously I had that story. I
told you guys about my sister. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Do you feel like it reflects
your kind of spiritual? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> I believe more. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I have a lot more respect
for spirituality than I do </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> religion. I think organized religion, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not too fond of the podcast
we're talking about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like take, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we're taking on every topic
that you shouldn't be talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> about right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I feel like for me
personally, it's like, again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because I did grow up
in a, I mean like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like the whole
Shintoist belief and you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> used to go to temples all
the time and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> would hear stories about, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my grandparents like being very, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Shintoist and just believing in again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the whole spirituality
and like spirituality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like something, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can get behind anything that
the general belief is a beat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Good. And you all get good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I was a kid, you know,
my grandma would tell me like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, like don't throw
the rubbish in the river. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Not because it's bad for the pollution, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but because the river God is
going to get angry at you and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> don't come back to bite you in
the. And I'm like, oh, well, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't want to angle them. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'll do that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It might be a little bit
of an OSS back was legit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But you know, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> as a kid like that is I think
a healthy way to like look at </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> a logical. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's get behind anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's generally just be
a nice person. That's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just give back. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like, I feel like I'm,
I want to do that just myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't need some kind of a
belief system for me to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to be a good person
and do that because I want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to give back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not walking around
as a 27 year old going, oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been in an angle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like at the back of my mind,
there is a pot where it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it builds like not only respect
for surroundings around you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also just becoming a
better person. And it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> you do what you have to believe in. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> As long as you're not hurting
anyone else believe what you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> have to believe in to be a better post. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - No, because like my
experience was, you know, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> obviously I was raised up to
be a Buddhist and everything </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like that and in my life. Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was so here's his, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's a bit more behind
that backstory. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was a monk when I was like, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Write it down, write it down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So as I said before, I was
among two times in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One time I was a kid,
one time it was an adult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So the kid thing was basically
doing it. So I could like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> give good karma to my family
because that's just how the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just how I was raised. You know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's two Jensey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought you were on
about Reddit then for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Funnily enough karma was
the concept that existed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, so then I, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so then after that I went to university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grew up in everything and
then I had this, I had this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, spiritual
experience with, with, with, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with some people. And then
after having that experience, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I kind of just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know what the right
word or the right term to like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> coin the SAS, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I just kind of realized
that I didn't know what the I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> believed. Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because, because, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because I had this experience
that I couldn't explain </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> logically, and I was
like an engineer before, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I'm like everything scientific, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything can be explained
logically had this experience. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I kind of
realized, what do I believe? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> And then there's one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then at that point I realized
everything that I believed </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> wasn't because I actually believed it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it was just because that
was what I was raised to be. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. That's, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> that's one thing that's really
difficult because I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you have to be raised,
will be raised by wolves. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's kind of hard to get
an unbiased view of like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> religion or spirituality, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you often have so much
baggage or kind of backstory </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that kind of thing. So it's
often hard to look at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was like actually a huge
turning point in my life that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> like basically pull my
Clate Sleen put me like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> put me on a clean slate.
And I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going to become a monk
now that, and that was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that was like the actual
point when I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm going to become a monk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Not because my parents told me to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but because I need to like
figure this out myself and figure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> out is this what I
actually believe? Or is it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> or is it something that was
instilled to me as a kid? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so that was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like the big
decision maker to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to start
something new in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to like try to
experience this lifestyle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not because not because anyone told me to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but because I chose this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I chose to experience this
and whatever comes out of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> experience and whatever comes
out of these beliefs are my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> own. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's why right now I, you
know, so I became a monk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> When, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when you were alone by yourself
with your thoughts for, for, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for four weeks or a month,
two months, you have, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you have a lot of time
to think about, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. And so in these, in
these like two months, you bet, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I basically had just like had
time to rewind my entire life </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> and basically break down why
I believe the things I do and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why I'm the person I am. And
like, after becoming a mom can, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after having that time to
myself and, you know, studying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I already knew
about, you know, Buddhist, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the British religion and the
Buddhist beliefs and the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so I, after that, I
knew what I believed out of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's say, what's the
traditional religion teaches you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I also had my own beliefs
and my own views on top of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It should be there. I think that's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you should take the calls of
something like a structure that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> you have a spirit or whatever you like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> and then just kind of add your
own of things that you really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want to Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is pretty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Notorious for that. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, yeah, this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is what we believe the whole thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like calmer as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I, I almost in like a scientific way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that if, you
know, if, if generally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're a good, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're a positive impact
on people. I think just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just comes back like every. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - Reaction as an </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Do I believe there's this cosmic system? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't have to think so. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I can just go and do whatever
the I want it, but yeah, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's got the soup kitchen. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - The kitchen. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But do I believe in, like in general, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> if you're a good person that
it will come back to you a </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> hundred percent? I believe, I
truly believe that I'm like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> that's that I guess is the biggest thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The biggest change before, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before me just being told what
to believe and actually like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> deciding what I believe it's
like once you decided it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or once I decided that
nothing can change my opinion, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm so like set in my beliefs
because this is basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything that I've built
from my entire experience of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the only thing that can
change this is new things I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> experienced. Because like,
because that, and to me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that's why I guess nothing
really phases me when it comes to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like, arguing about my
beliefs, like my core beliefs, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because I'm I'm so I'm very set in it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I feel like I have anything
controversial either. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I've just got to be good. I
mean, like you say, you, like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you had all this whole
experience, but I mean, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> ultimately we, we came to
the same conclusion right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Through our own means. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's what it's
about. I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't have a problem with
how however you want to do your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> life. Just don't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Don't be a negative impact. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Again, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're free to believe whatever
the you believe just don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like hurt or inconvenience others. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like what, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what me off is when people would
try to put their beliefs on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> other people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I have my core beliefs
and I firmly believed them, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> but I would never try to say,
Hey, this is my experience. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And you should experience
and believe exactly the same </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> things as me. Because,
because to me, you can't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you can't force that upon
someone, you know, you can, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> you can raise a kid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> but I hope my kid goes to the
exact same thing that I went </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> through when they realized,
I know I need to like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> decide the for myself. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm sure there's a lot
of people watching this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I've never thought about that
this deeply. And you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> that's not exactly a bad thing
because it's something that I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> never had to think about until
I had some experience that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> forced me to like, put myself,
put me in this position. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, there's nothing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> You can just go your whole
life. And you've been, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you've been raised to believe
a certain thing and you just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> never questioned it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's what I always
found quiet. Like, oh, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> cause I always always questioning
everything from like the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> get-go like anything they told
me, I was like, nah, I to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, which is strange. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I T I guess that's why
I'm so adverse to stuff like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that. Because ever since a young age, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can remember I was the
annoying kid who was like, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't, I don't think that's right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But that's just, cause
I didn't know how I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know why I got that mindset from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've always been like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is some people just
don't really question things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they just think, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> if I just follow what
everyone else believes, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and if I just follow the crowd,
then nothing can go wrong. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Right. So you're. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Telling me I'm a Sigma man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm saying that you're a. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Lead a Sigma. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You're a leader in your own mind. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just think some people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just have never thought that deeply </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about it. And that's fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's a lot of people I've met. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's a lot of people I've
met who are just happy and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they've, they've never
like they've honestly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I wish I was more like that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> because my God likes some people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Existential crisis in the bathtub. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Members of the church of
the flying spaghetti monster. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like what happy dude, we got
spaghetti most thrown outside. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. For me, for me, I just think just, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> don't try to put your
beliefs on other people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Try to accept what anyone else believes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Even if it's like different from yours, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can believe what the you want. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can like if people want
to hear about your experiences </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and give you the
opportunity, then go ahead, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tell your experiences, tell your beliefs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But if, if, if they're not interested, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which a lot of people are
not going to be interested, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then just give them that don't
get offended and don't get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> offended and don't get offended
when they believe something </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> different as well. He understood. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That whole aspect of it
getting really angry about other </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> people's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well like being like how
dare you don't believe the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing I believe in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I ain't never got that either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It just seems very like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like very like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like self concerned about
like feeding animals and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that. It's like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just want people to be
comfortable. So I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess if you have a
dietary requirement. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like one meal of my life
that we won't be able to eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pork. I think, I think I'll be all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'm not offended. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fine. I'm good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll I'll you know, and even
then it's like, it's, it's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's, it's kind of strange. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Steve to I'll go in a bit of
a lighter topic, but before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where's the poop. There's not
enough poop in this episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shipped myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I've been addicted to
like a new type of video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reasonably. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know you tweeted about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. You're just like,
it's like sometimes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes the YouTube algorithm
just works in mysterious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ways. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you know what sent a story
that starts off with that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sentence? Isn't going to lead to anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. So like, so like grandiose. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So like I, I get this video
recommended on my YouTube, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like, oh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I watched someone sharing
cow hooves and like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they get instant relief from bubbles. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, what's the? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What, what is, what is,
what is YouTube thinking? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We'd be interested in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have that section of like
videos that I never subscribe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> full, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but a pleasantly surprising
when I watched them stuff like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> restoration cleaning cars. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There was one that was
like testing mouse traps. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And this guy worked on a farm
and he just had like every </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> single mouse trap. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. And it was just like, weirdly, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like weirdly like kinda like, oh, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's cool how the trap works.
So I'm watching my style. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I of feel bad. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel the same way about like
guys who want to link massive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> ant farms and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That makes me so anxious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, like I want one, up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, you're just,
it's just ants everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just to say, I mean, he, he
doesn't have to invite people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think he gets out of having
to have the friends over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by you, but I've got the end phone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I remember just
watching the Calhoun videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never been, I've never
seen something that I've been, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is like disgusting, but
weirdly relaxing as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's it's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This it's because that comes off so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Clean, it comes off so clean
and just, it's kinda like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, it's, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's kinda like scratching
an H or something like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Whereas. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Videos. I don't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like seeing the, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> seeing the pus come out
of like the cowl hooves. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like disgusting. But like,
for some, for some reason, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> when you see the words,
instant relief in the title, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just like, I'm
happy for the cow man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm, I'm happy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Something about instant relief.
And the title is just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel better. I feel better for the cow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We used to just do with cows. If we did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't doing this,
they just like chilling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just would that look
disgusting? Terrorists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just know, standing out in the paddock, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just chewing grass being like, well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm an insufferable pain right
now, but you know, what am I. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Evolution. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kind of up. Then I feed them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just collect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Unable to clean them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because like these cattle hooves
are like hard because what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have to do, you use to share them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like raise a shop
and they can like barely, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> barely get through them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So how the these cows can
survive without humans is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beyond me. Cause I've seen
some of the cow videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Put them in like cages. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well maybe the reason
why, like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when cows tip over and they can't get up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not because they can't
get it just because they. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't want it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, oh, Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause like I imagine it it's
just like the worst ingrown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> toenail you've ever had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you don't have anything to cut it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like I've, I've had some
pretty bad ingrown toenails. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I feel some kind of
spiritual connection to the cow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just seeing this pus
come out right. If God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And make a video like that,
he put like instant relief. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Hashtag relatable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If it's relatable. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The me using a toilet
instantly satisfying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 30 Minute compilation.
You're using different. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Per days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Instant. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Relief for J complex. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Relatable. This place is very special. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I went to a restaurant. I
did want to vote it down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> One star. The toilet had an every day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was a really nice restaurant.
They'd never seen it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I was like, what the? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> What the got to go good at my
meal after I've just wiped my. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like an animal disgusting. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well maybe they expected you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to like finish the meal first. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Going. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Back to It's not. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's not. It's. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally, literally one week later. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not it's per days. And I love them. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> I'll be down for that, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll be down for that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's so bad. I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It depends on you. Cause you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> cause some people like different
strengths and stuff and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> some machines can't quite get
the strength. Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well, so it was like,
how accurate is that? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> First? Is that first? </SPEAKER_04>
