<SPEAKER_01> wanted to talk about anime tube we know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> chris goes into fits when we talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're gonna be like three weeks late but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole the bottle is kind of finished </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> now yeah talking about that we have all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the info </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it like lived and died within the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> span of a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think yes pretty much it was very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting essentially what happened is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> uh this thing called anime tube popped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up on kickstarter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and yeah offered to give all the kind uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone really yeah free anime free anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're probably thinking well you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know they probably only got like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know c rate shows yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah really terrible now what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> do they have they they said they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were in talks to get evangelion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> love hina which has been stuck in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> copyright halibut knock up right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> licensing specifically love hina i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who like just specifically picks lafina </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> attack on titan format alchemist even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> though these were already all on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> streaming platforms already yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know and i imagine that the ones that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aren't have been out of print for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> past </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twenty they say zero as well uh i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't see the list </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've got everything it's animate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> shoes you know i mean you know and so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know how much these properties </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> are worth but i can't i can't imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you getting evangelion for less than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 100 million or something ridiculous </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know probably sounds absurd but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably worth that much right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so clearly these guys are big bucks to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> spend around i mean i'm just glad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a company is giving the power back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the people and taking on small indie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> companies like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so [ __ ] license holders yeah so taking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on small indie companies like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sony and att you know like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> someone's going to take these what were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they going to do what were they going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do with it so yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> essentially this kickstarter promised </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that and it and it raised in like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 110 000 yeah it literally came out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> nowhere because i remember we were we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally came in the trash taste studio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it was just all over my twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> timeline i was like what the hell was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> going on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we all looked at it and we were just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like wait this kickstarter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> launched yesterday and it's raised over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a hundred thousand dollars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> promising people free anime legally and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what is going on right now it was an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> absolute disaster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> april was about three months ago guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're a bit late to the joke right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was just uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a mess it was hilarious it was a mess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the you know i think it it's so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> levels to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so many things that are really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sad about it one um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i think it's safe to say that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this was uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> either the most over ambitious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kickstarter of all time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah uh or it was uh they were lying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the most genius scam now yeah i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know you have to be careful when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say these guys because you can get uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sued so trying to get trash take suit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here jerry okay but from what i i i saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a scam </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah well i mean i'm protecting myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not going to say the s </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> word but uh i'm going to say that it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looked very sus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll say the other little sassy scam </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a sassy bucket is what it is you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know i genuinely wonder because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know again they promised to have all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> these titles that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's absolutely you know not even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> netflix or amazon can get all of these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shows right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is some serious amount of cash and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> negotiating power </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that i doubt a kickstarter would be able </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to convince the japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> investors flicks and like sony can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even get the rights to some of these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what what suggests to anyone that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this kickstarter group will be able to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like evangelion literally couldn't be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even been out of print for the past 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years you couldn't get the license trip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> until netflix somehow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably don't even want to know how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> much netflix is playing for that oh no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the creator didn't even have the rights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to it for the longest time until i had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to [ __ ] fight with guy naxx to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's insanity yeah i mean the thing is i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's as you said there's so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> layers to it because you know in theory </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a nice idea you know having </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> somewhere where you can watch anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> legally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> feels bad because we're like laughing at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like imagine trying to take on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the big guy hahaha funny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but but like if it was a good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> attempt i would be yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right if it was a good attempt but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> keep in mind you're taking on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> companies like sony like netflix you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know like like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who you know have have a bit of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> dollar in their pocket you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like yeah i i don't think we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to be like yeah we love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> corporations and stuff like that because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like a lot of this was driven by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know the people's hatred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> towards corporations and you know i get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it you know if you don't want to support </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the big corporations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because of whatever reason you know i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> get it but there's there's a difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not wanting to support like big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> corporations and then like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> supporting like whatever this is yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's blindly accepting anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like not wanting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like not wanting to buy paracetamol </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for your pharmacy so you go to like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> local drug dealer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like like what's the yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's like betting in a horse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> race but the horse's two legs that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i felt so kind of just sad about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really i felt sad that there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> enough weebs out there that were this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> desperate to like stick it to the carpet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would throw that money into a void </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dude weebs want free [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at the end of the day this is also what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't understand is that we have weebs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are this dedicated to say [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to companies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are willing to give money away but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you could they could just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pirate if they really want to really get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it for free i'm not saying you should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i condone that do not do it but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean it's also like you're kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> basically composing i mean it's also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the money that they gave to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kickstarter right because like there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were a lot of people who are giving like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hundreds of dollars to this kickstarter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and like some some people i saw were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> giving literally thousands of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean there was starter when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looked there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a thousand backers giving a hundred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thousand so it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rough on average a hundred dollars each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> given a lot of money that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know a year's subscription yeah to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> netflix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not what the message i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's about sending a message the message </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of i got scammed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah well i mean it's it's the it's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing is where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if anyone just like literally used a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> single brain cell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you think about like the logistics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the logistics like just the logistics of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would not work in the first place or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know a hundred thousand seems </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like any normal person it's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drop in the [ __ ] bucket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like anime licensing features and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all that stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can maybe license half an episode no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no not even that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can maybe license the thumbnail </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about an image half an episode of like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> c to your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much yeah anime i mean yeah like we and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what surprised me is that they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the shows that they were listing as the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shows they were going for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what like the [ __ ] triple a titles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are worth millions and millions of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> dollars right i mean god knows how much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> netflix actually paid to get evangelion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of licensing hell because evangelion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was out of like life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't be licensed by any western </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> company for like feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a decade literally since it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> made yeah yeah like since since like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> since adv like collapsed i can't think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of any other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like company that has successfully </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> licensed evangelion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i think people like to think of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime still this kind of underground </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thing but some of these shows are easily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know worth over hundreds of millions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of dollars like these types </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right like i think the merchandising of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> these shows as well right think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the ips shows i think about the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mega shows like any of the shonen jump </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> shows like my hero </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> how much does attack on titanfall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] demonstrate yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean a billion dollar property yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah exactly it's already proven to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really i just i don't understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> none of this i who were these thousands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of people who gave money like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> legitimately wanted that yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> legitimately want to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's obviously very young impressionable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anime fans right who are just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hoping for this yeah society right i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wonder if some parts of it we're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> completely like oblivious about like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we take for granted some of them like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we yeah i mean we work with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese companies we know how these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't go around saying you're in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> talks that is that is like the biggest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no-no in business </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like and especially here i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's never a done deal until it's done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dealing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> did you read the faq what was that that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what do they say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh okay i read some of it what was the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you remember the thing about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> licensing or something yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember like one of the faqs uh one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of the questions was uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't anime licensing really expensive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they they legit went um actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um anime licensing isn't as expensive as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone makes it out to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the only reason nobody does it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> nobody talks about it is because of ndas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we are in talks with real japanese anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> licenses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh that was pretty much that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty much the answer to the question </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can they get anime licenses they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally just shot themselves in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> foot they just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they didn't have to answer that question </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't say you're talking to these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> companies like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very also it's all very secretive you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah intentionally so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all these companies are like yeah do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know this guy yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because there was a guy there was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so they also uh i think the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> person uh i'm not sure the ceo someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> representing right stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime yeah yeah which is the american </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> company i think which uh buys the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> licenses for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> again i'm not sure either way they they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> buy a license or they sell or they sell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> dvds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they reached out being like uh so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> apparently you've listed some of our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> titles </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> the guy tweeted him saying that we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> never been in talks </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> it was just it all burned down in flames </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> luckily but yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just oh my god it was such a it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just so bizarre to see and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know we knew it was gonna like come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down in flames yeah i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think right now it's like been taken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off kickstarter right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as far as i can so yeah okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's still there but but the funding is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> stopped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh okay so so now i'm going to give them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anymore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's good okay that's good okay okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so yeah it is so kick start suspended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 111 000 yeah i like i don't know how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> true this is but i did see a screenshot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i might </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> prop up my timeline the other day though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that uh shows that they haven't given up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've started like a newsletter which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they which you can subscribe to for a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dollar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so for a dollar for this newsletter you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can subscribe for updates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people are just taking updates of what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> talks in the end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know i legit don't know and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like it is like on this week's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> newsletter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're in talks with adv trying to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the right it's just it's just absolutely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tragic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's obvious that you know i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being funny but there's a reason why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> netflix doesn't have its own discord </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> server as well they had their own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> discord </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> server and they started banning people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like what is this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is [ __ ] yandere devs game what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is this this is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's going on here it's so obvious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because they've done this like two times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before yeah as well and they failed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i saw they've made other kids so so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're trying to make this kickstarter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is their third attempt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i think another app similar to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> popped up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the microsoft store and was taken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> down before as well so yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have a history of doing this and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> failing and whatever but clearly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know every time it comes around it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seems to get some money so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess why not i guess i got some real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> balls to do it like three or four times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no shame man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm sorry if you [ __ ] gave money to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that kickstarter like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean like like i i would say like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i like the idea no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> intentions yeah intentions aside i like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the idea of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everybody wishes for it i mean everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everybody wishes for because i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the era we're we're in now i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like we're past the golden age of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> streaming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we'll pass the point in time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you could get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every show that you've physically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> feasibly watched on one platform and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's unfortunate that that's the case um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's kind of evolved into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a similar era to what the cable era </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i mean when p when corporations </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> started to realize that there was money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in streaming this was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this was going to be the way that things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were going to evolve unfortunately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately money talks you know and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if there could be a platform where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> every anime you ever watch was on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> single platform i'm sure someone would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have done that already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i'm sure someone with a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> money would have done that already i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hate to be the bearer of bad news but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime is a business </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> streaming is one of those people is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's nigh on impossible to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> into it unless you've got like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah massive investors yeah like maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe like 10 15 years ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's good maybe you know if you at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> start of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> streaming age like when crunchyroll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> first started but like that time's past </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> now you can't just you can't just be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the little guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> taking on the big guy anymore oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like quibby as well i had like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like six billion dollars yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was made it was founded by the guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who uh left disney and founded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dreamworks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh come from his name um and made quibby </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a streaming service </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was an absolute dumpster </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it had like billions of dollars in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> investments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it disappeared after like two weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right or something well it was like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> got a free trial then you had to pay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and like it literally just tanked like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> immediately yeah yeah yeah like and but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> paid for so many original shows as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just wait who's on there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't [ __ ] know i i didn't go on i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't i didn't yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't even know about this oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah how did you know about this a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couple of years ago i think was it a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> couple of years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was like two years ago i think yeah no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like a year ago was it i think it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> might i don't [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a recent map i don't even count </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> last year last year frankly just flew by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i i can't i can't remember anything did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that happen 2019 it was a year ago yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm still 22 as far as i'm concerned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] king crimson like existed in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 2020 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just like [ __ ] erased the entire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> year and we just skipped it literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> felt like last month </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like april 2020. this is really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i mean we're already halfway </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> through 2021 which is terrifying didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mixer die as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah mixer died oh yeah yeah man [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wish i got offered to move to mixer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'd have got a nice cash out and ninja's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like set for life and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's the only reason anyone knows about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mixer i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but like yeah i mean like even with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> those failed platforms they had like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> millions and billions of dollars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> invested into them by angel investors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they definitely weren't started by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] kickstarter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah and and unfortunately like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what's what what would be like the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> successful kickstarter of all time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what what i don't know what's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's very telling that we can't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'm sure there is some good ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out there i just i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've never been interested yeah to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pursued any good kickstarter you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just buy the thing when it [ __ ] comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> out yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah and and because i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking with the money that with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kickstarter can be people can invest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into kickstarter even like the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> successful kickstarter of all time would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably have trouble </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting into the streaming field the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> only one i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was those like sunglasses that had the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> built-in headphones into it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember those that was successful there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was a kickstarter i remember it because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like during </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my uni days but there was this there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this pair of sunglasses where on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here it was like this new technology and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> audio where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it would vibrate and the vibrations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would travel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> through your ears and the music will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come into yours and i remember it was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> successful kickstarter i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> millions of dollars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's not successful yeah but is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that the most successful kickstarter of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is the most success are you kidding me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nabi number eight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh number eight the who yeah is like how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much money did the ouya raise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> uh eight million five hundred ninety six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> thousand eight yeah but you gotta bear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in mind right even if even if someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> raised </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 20 million </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even if somebody raised 200 300 million </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dollars that doesn't mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] for streaming you can't you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> buy much with that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no that's what that's what i'm trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say like even with the most successful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kickstarters of all time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to get into this field you need external </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> investors </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if if they really want to challenge the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big guys you know because there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a lot of money in there right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it broke yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you could gather all the anime fans in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the wall and it probably won't even be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> enough don't understand people can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> invest in kickstarter after like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just track record it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> poorly have you ever donated to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kickstarter no why you saved like 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you got to put 100 in for some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like i'll just wait till it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comes out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i've done i've done a few but not like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the stupid amount of money that some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time i look at a kickstarter and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see like the you know the top tiers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a thousand ten thousand dollars and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see like one left two left i'm like who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are these people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they're just dropping ten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> thousand dollars for stuff that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> genuinely needs the money i would be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> more inclined like a game or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that i like i'm into i would but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i haven't though but yeah most of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> time the stuff that gets the most is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just like [ __ ] pre-orders essentially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the products made they know what they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> doing and you're just pre-ordering yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean with kickstarter i feel like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a small indie project or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feasibly getting funded on kickstarter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i would support it i mean i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think the last kick starter i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> supported was actually uh the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trigger anime i think they funded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the second ova of like little witch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> academy yeah yeah yeah i supported that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that makes sense to me that seems like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this is why kickstarter should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> exist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah but like if you're if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming in trying to change like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stir up an entire industry or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kickstarter is just not going to do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anymore i think kickstarter is really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know a small indie team to do some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of project </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a [ __ ] industry changing project </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need something else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> usually kickstarters is for like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know like kind of it stops at an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> artistic level right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not really the thing that you go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into to be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm gonna cause a scene in the in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> industry you know [ __ ] everything on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kickstarter is the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] it's like all right get the stock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> image of people running </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> play the play the music mood and the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the you know the you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the ukulele on that one or like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always there's always some like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> motivational thing and then it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have you ever had this problem that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't a problem well now we can solve it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it looks amazing and then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think about it like it's all [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's always it's always the same type of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people that are kick-started too isn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it yeah it's always like the way to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> overly enthusiastic like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> my name is kyle it'll be either it'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> either be someone from california or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone from eastern europe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like with a really thick accent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> explaining why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> his fridge is the best fridge and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's cool that's fine i just don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> want it with our last project the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walking fridge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we raised two hundred thousand dollars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's insane i just i just realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that kickstarters are basically the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> modern infomercials </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i just don't believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any any any single advertisement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where someone gives it to a random </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like whoa it's amazing i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just don't believe that i if even if it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just don't want i don't i don't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> believe it when there's another thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which says like not a paid actor yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you sure about that oh you did you said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> go back to anime tube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> did you see the [ __ ] testimonials </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i think they just got like some random </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> people they found on discord to give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them testimonials of that app or </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> five stars that's great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those [ __ ] were like two out of ten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the box was bruised </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like people people like rate furniture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're they're like it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> complicated to build </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh two stars and i'm like but that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> truly that's just like that's on you bro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i feel like that's that's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interpretation thing like is the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> good yeah at the end of the day you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only going to build it for like one hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or two hours or so there are some times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when i'm just like how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm pretty sure you need a phd to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> translate okay this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is the instruction manual that they gave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> every item there's just like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing i know what you mean but at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same time like my okay i have a coffee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> table right now that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so over engineered and the amount of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> screws and [ __ ] for it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> totally stupid yeah that was three hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of like the two years i've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> using it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't give a [ __ ] about those three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hours looking back now that's why i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> write the review like three months after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i get it because then i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah it's good it's just still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> standing that's why i wait if it breaks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after like one month all right fine but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's one star i shouldn't have broke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one month if i use it but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people these people who write it and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like um the cardboard box was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slightly damaged you know the furniture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> took a little longer than i'd like to it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] off the delivery man had a bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> attitude like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's got nothing to do with anything and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then as well even if it breaks i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right how long reasonably did i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expect it to last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like my bed's broken is that but it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two years is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he also spent like 100 bucks on it it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was 300 bucks for the mattress and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is very cheap for a bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> considering how much we've spent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh like on amazon to get like our first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> furniture i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the furniture i have right now has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> lasted very well um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my bed is like the this design of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bed is when i was building that i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> huh this doesn't seem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> super structurally stable i understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why i was three stars now yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well basically you know that meme with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the cheeto in the door holding the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> door closed there's like a tiny plank </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a piece of plywood </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that basically is like holding up the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> middle of the bed and like all the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that doesn't sound safe no and uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you stood on that and jumped on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> would just crack right well one time i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i like just like like because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know i i wouldn't say i get into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bed aggressively yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> like oh yeah that's the thing though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the comfort envelopes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but i feel like the thing is you know i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean uh i feel like that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> admitting you're just single if you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> a memory foam one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's like it's not it's not an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exciting bed you know </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> i mean i don't i don't use memory foam </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> beds so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go then you know what i mean i like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> like this </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> sleep paralysis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get do i up need to explain this come on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i get it i get it sometimes you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you just want to play a bit of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> basketball right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just want to dribble some balls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you need to like dribble you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> know what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can you catch my drift guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but like spring breads are like awful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for that they they're they are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good you can use this same bread </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't i you literally said stupid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> have you ever slept on a water bed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> before i imagine i imagine that must be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's really fun it's like literally is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that actually fun is it comfortable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really okay i find it to be super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] comfortable but that's because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's but i find memory foam to be really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comfortable so it's kind of like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the mattress kind of follows you as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're moving around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but then like if you're if you're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in a if you're like you become the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> mattress you get a double memory foam </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mattress so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you guys are like never going to touch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> each other you guys are going to be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have our we have our crevice it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> set </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's why that's what i don't like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about memory foam mattresses that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a single like a single bed there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no movement i'm not seeing enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anywhere on a memory foam mattress you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sink in and that's just it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what that's what couples do when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they like agree that they're just not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having sex anymore like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what that is true everything so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> let me just sink into my car yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you have your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you literally if your memory foam is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like set you it's so uncomfortable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to move to a position where it isn't set </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what about what about memory foam </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pillows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah i like the pillows yeah do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like the pillows nah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i like feeling that i like it i like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> little resistance i like a little bounce </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like whatever i'm [ __ ] the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> pillowcard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i like when the pillow fights yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i think the pillow needs like a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> bit of firmness i like when the pillow's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> at scenario you know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you see if you're sinking too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> then i feel like being able to like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know if i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of just not happy with the pillow i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can just like punch the [ __ ] out of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah literally until you're like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right it is refreshed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because you guys sometimes you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> could just you just gotta [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> tenderize the pillow right you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna get the [ __ ] steak tenderizer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right now it's perfect i used to i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> used to use two pillows exclusively but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now for some reason i can't use two is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that like getting old is that an old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no i've i've actually gone the opposite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i used to be able to sleep on one pillow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but now i need two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't do two anymore it has to be one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe because my when i was a child uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when i was a child sorry my mom already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the shittest thinnest pillows maybe that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was why ah so i was like yeah i always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sleep with two and i'm like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yo i always stick with two pillows no i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the opposite like i had like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really really thin pillows right and we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't afford another pillow so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that's why yeah i think that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why i had two so i was like why am i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waking up with a headache every morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh it's because all the blood is rushing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this japan has these pillows that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get in like hotels and stuff that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which ones like double-sided ones yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but double-sided pillows double-sided no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> no so like that there's two different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> types of material on each side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and one of them is literally like solid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bean bag like it's like a bean bag that </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> i was like yeah dude that was so fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's do it again almost died let's do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i haven't mentioned like have you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guys had any near-death experiences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i told the story about how i'd like got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> launched with a bounce castle right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yes oh yeah that was probably one as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well yeah cause i remember i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember telling you this uh like a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> days ago but uh i think the nearest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> death experience i had was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the most probably the most lamest story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i could tell yeah but uh it was during a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> snowball fight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so so in university </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh in england we don't get lost though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we get like snow once or twice a year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and so anytime it snows everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> takes the opportunity to play around in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the snow and in university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what that means is we just go out and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have a bunch of snowball fights right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it was uh like one dorm versus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another dorm and we were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having a snowball fight in the middle of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this like residential area in bristol </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right so it wasn't like in the middle of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a field or something it was literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like on the roads and the pavements uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember we were just throwing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> snowballs and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one [ __ ] right you you know you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the snowballs and some you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the common courtesy is you make the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> powder snowballs yes of course of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right of course one [ __ ] decided to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> make an ice ball </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what i mean the ones where it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like melted ice and you [ __ ] pack it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in and it's on the side of the road yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on the side of the road where you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this didn't put a stone in it people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> used to do that in my school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> seriously i feel like ice balls are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> even worse because you get you get the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you get the hardness of the ice and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coldness as well which is like numbing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as well it's basically just getting a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cold rock yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so i was i was standing right by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the side of the road and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i see the snowball coming and i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's a snowball whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hits my [ __ ] balls and then i realize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> number one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is perfect aim because it literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hit my balls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> number two that is not a snowball i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> felt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is a solid ice ball that just came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> full force right onto my [ __ ] balls i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i have a really similar story but he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> said total opposite it was at the beach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and uh and my dad and i were at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the beach i think i was like maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 11 12 years old right and my dad and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were kicking like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the rugby ball around and like one thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i really liked was trying to catch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the ball that gets kicked really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> high up and then you kind of get under </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that right so we were doing that a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> couple of times i was practicing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and one time my dad just kicks it really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] high up and i was like alright i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sun's in my eyes but i got it i think i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got this and it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comes down it misses my arm and it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> perfectly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flicks my knob </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it just flicks out that's the brush </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> land on my balls it just flicked it like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like that on my knob and i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> collapsed yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was because like i like if if you if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not a guy if you're not a male </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really hard to describe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the pain you feel when your knob gets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> flicked or some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so obviously this happened to me and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i was in total agony </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right because your mind just goes blank </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i start like walking forwards and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't realize i was walking right into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the middle of a road right because i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like i was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh [ __ ] and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the last thing i remember is my mate go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go what the [ __ ] and he grabs my bag and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> pulls me back right everyone pulls me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back and then i just see this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bus just going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right in front of me and uh yeah that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was that was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was the closest i've come to dying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i think imagine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dying while grabbing your balls i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you actually just missed out on your own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> isa guy story yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that was your chance that that was one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drop yeah that was that was literally </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> great when your friends came over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you could just [ __ ] fight on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah we didn't have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> backyard big enough for a trampoline </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i didn't have that much space yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> my backyard's pretty big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um well you're a country boy aren't you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's whales </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's great we just fight on it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as you do so in other news uh japan is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> back on lockdown </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no way we you know what we had a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> pleasant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two weeks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what blows my mind is that they they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cancel spectators like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> now for the olympics it's starting this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> month right yeah like in a couple weeks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah what the [ __ ] actually by the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this is up it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> probably probably started yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> insane to me that they cancelled it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this like the spectators this late when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know but the athletes are still live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean that's that's i mean i get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that but like as if they didn't know how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bad the situation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was it's like whoa [ __ ] didn't get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better suddenly what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know it's just to me it's insane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you know it's also just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> irresponsible as well because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably people who booked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hotels you know because even in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right you can come from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hokkaido wherever the [ __ ] you are you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can come and watch poor people probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> book time off work maybe probably booked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> some hotels yeah they use their limited </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like payless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like the cyberpunk release but just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like on a scale 10 times that you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if somebody booked time off work in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan they ain't playing around no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't happen like the japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> government just puts out a tweet which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is just like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the yellow thing yeah we have delayed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the olympics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we have cancelled spectators we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> apologize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean it's just yeah unfortunately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not we're gonna have to wait even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> longer for the new figure episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because uh we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we're still under a new lockdown </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just feels like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this entire year has just been a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lockdown but not really for us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it feels like now that the rest of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> world is kind of getting back to normal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really weird seeing timelines where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people are having parties and going out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with our masks and stuff and i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah this is just this is just life this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is life yeah this is just life now for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> us right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's weird because it's like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't i know we've talked about this a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot before but it's because it's such an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ongoing thing and it changes throughout </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the time it's like all right restaurants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right okay cool but now they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> close to eight all right okay but now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they consider alcohol okay but now they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what's going on what the [ __ ] is going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on it's just i'm so confused </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three no the limit is six the limit is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> four yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it's like all right and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> google maps is completely unreliable now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> all the opening and closing times are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] live yeah because it's totally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dependent on the place and whether </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're doing it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> most of the time they're not the ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> updating their google page so you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even know if shit's open or not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the only thing that has stayed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> consistent throughout this entire thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that's literally corn only thing that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> stayed consistent pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean you want to go to a new place now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you check out on google maps oh they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're open you turn up at the door </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're not open and then you try to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> find another place and it's just kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like playing a roulette wheel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of just seeing what you can do because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's locked down has been really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird because we say lockdown but it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can you can still go out and work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you just can't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> do anything else about that i mean the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> trains are still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] packed as [ __ ] oh yeah if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> get an eight o'clock train still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you're [ __ ] yeah it's you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know you do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you still get squeezed in like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there will be people pushing you in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> still uh during all of this and that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why a lot of the experts say it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so worrying uh in tokyo because the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> density is insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you can't you can't just social </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> distance anywhere in this [ __ ] town </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> um and yeah did you see that thing with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the tokyo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> hotel or something where it was like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> foreigners have to get a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> elevator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> from the japanese yeah i saw that i saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> classic japanese xenophobia i i heard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it was a misunderstanding i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if this is true that's what they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so i heard this was a misunderstanding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of especially for people who came from a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> foreign country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh right even though realistically right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're probably safer if you've come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from a foreign country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i think that was a lot of the even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though like some people were trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> defend it being like no no they meant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people who just came in from like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> america or whatever you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and but a lot of people arguing so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah well japan has not handled this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very well i don't think they're in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> place to be able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i don't even think what is this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like less than ten percent of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> populations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got the vaccine right it's something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably higher now but yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but i mean still it's like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nowhere near where it should be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> considering the olympics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to me it just seems like why not just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> socially distance in general </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the elevator why not just let two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people go in at a time on the opposite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> end why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to make it like the distinction it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just yeah i don't know it's uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean they could be that's just japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is just a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know the thing that sucks about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> japan is that they're just a little too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> quick on the decision to make it harsh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with making foreign rules they're always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like a little too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like something it's like is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something wrong it's the foreigners </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just a little it's just it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just the speed at which they'll be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe we should just maybe just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> discriminate a little bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm feeling a little discriminated for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it today it's like the image of that guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> falls off the bicycle and she's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh it's the foreigner you know i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the one time you know they people do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> try and justify it and all that but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just the ease at which sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> japan does it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which bothers me the most like we had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that thing from uh the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think did you talk about the podcast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the ibaraki prefecture uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think we haven't talked about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> prefecture uh gave a warning out for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people not to interact with foreigners </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's right yeah that was one of their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> ones oh yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> foreigners um i think again people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> defended some people found it being like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they only have people from a foreign </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> country but there's no way for japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people to be able to distinguish between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> persons who came from a foreign country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recently yeah it was very obvious what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they were trying to say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh which was just stay away from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> foreigners yeah you know which uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean it's it's it's like the massive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yikes if if this happened in literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any other country they'd just be called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out for it right right you know and by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> by everyone yeah i mean luckily though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a sense like at least what i've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on social media </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they have been called out yeah that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why they're so quick to retract and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> being like oh no it was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> misunderstanding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was it was retracted very fast and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> mean you can imagine why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah it's supposed to be very it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an inferior the hotel is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like quite a uh what's it notable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hotel it's a big friend it's a big big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's generally an expensive change yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is it an expensive chain yeah the tokyo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel is a very lightweight it's hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh i didn't i thought it was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this really it's a premium hotel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> excessive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know normally for rich tourists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like if the hilton was like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> asians yeah it's that level </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's you know so uh it's just uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sad very sad yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i forgot what i was going to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something i had a really good point but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i [ __ ] forgot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm dumb must have been a good point it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was such a riveting point but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh well lost the time yeah oh well i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean i mean it's just like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know obviously we're grateful to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here but it's just it's weird that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we it's it's not exactly that we feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> discriminated against </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously it's just sometimes there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like a lot of little things that we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we feel and obviously hearing news </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like this it kind of like adds to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> little by little yeah i mean when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> speak to someone my age i've never ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that in japan at all i just feel that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the government and like almost in every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> country it's just yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the people kind of out of touch yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really yeah i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but i feel it's especially relevant in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan because again the older </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> populations gosh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the majority right yeah the difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that that's totally fine because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what the voters want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly literally all the voters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean wasn't it like one of the people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> on the jab on the olympic committee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like just saying that women women </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shouldn't talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and just stay in the kitchen or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> something like that there was something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was something along the lines of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> women shouldn't be allowed to talk at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meetings because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they talk to you they talk oh that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah yeah at the olympic olympic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meetings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that's what dudes in the 50s used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to say to their wives </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that was the ex-prime minister of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan was it it was the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he was the prime minister of japan as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> far as i'm aware can you google it to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> confirm that but as far as i know it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the ex-prime minister of japan which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just very telling um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not saying you know the uk is much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> better we're [ __ ] awful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah uh but again they're they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> very quick to get called out by it but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then people calling out the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese government for a lot of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff you know a lot of the time is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> younger people who are doing it like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> elderly the social media generation yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the ex prime minister of japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he's also he's also like what 91 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> years old or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's the [ __ ] like i'm not being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> funny but no one 91 years old should be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making countries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i just i think at that point you were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just so far out of touch with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> country yeah absolutely you you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean i mean it's just like at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that point you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really i mean you're 91 right why would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you care to change </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for society because you know at that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> point you already know who you are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're not going to put in the effort to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> change exactly um and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just yeah at that point you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> probably shouldn't be running a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah a country you know i mean like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> joe ben like 70 something but then like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bernie makes me always think like damn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay maybe old people maybe they know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah i think they forgot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess that says </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not too political in the show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is probably the most political </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we've ever gotten on the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's naming politicians </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he said the name </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i don't know it's one of those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things where it's like i don't know it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah they're a little too comfortable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with uh dishing that [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that then like whenever i hear stories </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that there's a part of me that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hears that kind of stuff happening and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just makes me wish that young people in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan were a little more politically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> interested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah they pretty much have no interest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely or even if they do they don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talk about it no one talks about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> publicly barely anyone has any interest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no one believes in the government here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just like yeah whatever they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just doing their thing yeah as long as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're not in a war with another country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're good yeah the consensus seems to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be from what i've speak to people is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they're like oh i don't care as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> long as they don't like ruin my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a lot of young people who don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even know who the prime minister is yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it just it just goes to show like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're that out of touch but in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't get to choose the prime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minister no you choose the party and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then they choose the prime minister </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whereas you know i think that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> technically the same in the uk but it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not done like that at all we promised </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who the person is when we're voting and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how it is yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you wrote for the party uh and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't get to say who they pick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but again it's like i've talked to young </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people you know some same age a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a little bit younger and there's a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of them who don't even know what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> political parties are or what they do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> interested in it whatsoever and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like i kind of get the vibe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that everyone is just like so overworked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have time to care it's the last thing i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> want to worry about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's pretty it's that's pretty much the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> vibe i get is like everyone's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] fighting for the life here as it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know everyone's just trying to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the day they don't they don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> have time to care about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other other issues a lot of the time i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> remember when they like raised the gst </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from eight percent to ten percent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was like all these like mobs i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saw that there's all these mobs of all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these old people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how [ __ ] dare you me all the young </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people like understandable have a nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day i'll just work harder </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like they just don't care it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh they made a new law </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sick i guess i'm just gonna have to mold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my life around this new law now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah did you what was this speaking of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dumb japanese laws </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you can be arrested in japan if you uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mod uh games like save files </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that sounds all right can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> arrested and fined 65 000 pounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about uh about a k in dollars um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for selling breath of the wild save </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> files that were modded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seriously yeah no check and apparently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i've read about it apparently one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the main reasons why this law was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> passed was uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because guess which company pushed for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it nintendo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah of course they did but obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they tried obviously that [ __ ] just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> america's like lamar no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're not passing that law in america </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah because you have the right to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do whatever you want with the products </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you buy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah but yeah nintendo somehow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> managed to very much push for something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to be fair like i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the selling part was the problem right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like if you just like put it on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's also it's also illegal to even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> modder switch oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't mod a switch but i think it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't it technically illegal everywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to mod a switch or no no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so in the us it's counted as you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bought a product and you're allowed to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do whatever you want with that product </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can you can do whatever you want so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the illegal part then buying the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting the games apparently so i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think the way they managed to pass the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> law is that like it's still like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ongoing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing like a service you don't actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> own the game right you own a copy of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and by changing it you're like ruining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you buy a nintendo product nintendo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> owns you it's insane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is no escape you know like it's uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apple try i don't know if it's illegal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and again can you check it if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> illegal to jailbreak your phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't i'm pretty sure it's not a i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i think it's in every country i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know is is it or does it just break </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> warranty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i thought i thought it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> broke warranty in the uk i can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> remember though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it definitely at least breaks warrant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah every everyone knows that but uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> generally that's what the [ __ ] you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with the stuff you own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've never heard of anyone getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> arrested for jailbreaking well to me i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just the idea of a like a [ __ ] a raid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like into some guy's house like get down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stop drop the legend of zelda copies put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them on the floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know in japan right the thing is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in japan right boys rock up with hazmat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they arrest people in japan they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't arrest you with two people they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> send like 20 [ __ ] police officers in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> japan when they arrested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the boys down man they go they got the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> whole squad coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> overall it's breaking your iphone's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> warrant yeah yeah yeah it's absolutely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guaranteed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it differs between the country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in terms of like apple it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they're not going to [ __ ] sue you for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> doing it yeah yeah so it's just your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> warranty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's yeah that's but i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's understanding well most products </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do that like hey if you [ __ ] change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're not going to fix it for you if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> break a seal that says this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> breaking the ceo breaks the warranty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then generally you know that breaks the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> warranty right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but then i feel you know you also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to understand that japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is you know falling a little bit short </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> common sense laws like uh fair use for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> example yeah i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean failures just isn't the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> here just seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all these videos of like nintendo fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> playing with nintendo to like change </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their mind and then like after living </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here i'm like dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's it's not going to happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not how it rolls </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's like us pleading with nintendo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is not going to [ __ ] do anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unless you should start unless you're in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the start-up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let's get them to change the law unless </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> unless you are unless you are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh fully 100 japanese and in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boardroom meeting with them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it isn't going to matter are miami it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> not gonna change yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely like coming coming to live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here and seeing how it works on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> inside i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's a lot of like no matter how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much noise gets made on twitter i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most of the time it's gonna fall on deaf </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ears yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the way that i just i've come to realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> living here you can say anything you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want over an email you can explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything as well as you want through a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different person but unless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is a japanese guy there in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> room yeah at the board meeting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explaining something directly to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> person it will not get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you can't have a zoom call no you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't send an email </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't send an angry tweet you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you can [ __ ] ratio the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of nintendo they'll be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't give a [ __ ] you know you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to have someone there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explaining to the person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in person speaking fluent japanese and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> possibly having a japanese passport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before they take anything seriously and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even then it's like uh so what company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you work for who are your backers who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are you representing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you know i've worked at places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where i've wanted to shoot there and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've had a friend tell them who wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese hey can we shoot that and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like no i don't know about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then you have a japanese person do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the exact same thing like if cajo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hits them up and it's like hey here's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what we're doing and then like oh okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sure yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like what it's just like they don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> believe you like i think you're lying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're not japanese like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't understand you don't understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how sneaky foreigners trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> get around our ways it's yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bizarre it's really strange but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the way that it's like business </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is done here like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's and you know it makes it makes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much sense now why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these companies do this [ __ ] stupid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i'm like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i totally get it and i'm i'm kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like sitting in that halfway point right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because like if i don't open my mouth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they'll be like this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the moment foreign open my mouth they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh you're nihongo nihongo jose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah all right let's do it i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right let's do business yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> let's do exactly i rock up let's do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> business no you're a foreigner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jk i am nihongo jose actually and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like all right i'm sorry all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's do some business i'm like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> embarrassing yeah yeah and i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> companies in japan are very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very um what's the word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they very much stick to the hierarchy of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> decisions yeah and if you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're not like the same level you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't comment are you talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the pyramid the pyramids the pyramids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well like if you're if you're not like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're not in that like that that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meeting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your opinion doesn't matter no matter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> who you talk to right so i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when people are like all right even if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know because nintendo has a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nintendo america i i'd love to know how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much nintendo of america has a say over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nintendo the japan officers i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> probably not a lot i feel like people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i think it's probably not a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just based off like what i've seen from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other companies here where you'd think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they would have an input but they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's doug bowser is like uh so can we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> change this thing and they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we're in a zoom call yeah you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the office </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know about that i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again it's all speculation but i imagine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if any from what i've seen here it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very difficult to get things done if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so basically like the longer i live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in japan the more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> respect i have for suzaku and code geass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you watch code gyasa and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone wants to be right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone wants to be the [ __ ] lelouch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bring down the system </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] the corporations but then i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yo suzaku is out there working his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] ass off to change it man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like he's the real one he's the real one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> climbing that pyramid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's driving the hierarchy man if if if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this was irl suzaku would still be a </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> certain smell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm just like i can't describe what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is but i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it just feels comforting and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't know that airports smell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different until you go off the airplane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like damn this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i recognize this i don't know if i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like i don't know if this is the talk of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a madman right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no no i i get that whole smell thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i don't i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's like when certain smells </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> trigger i just feel like it's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> breathability of the country you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like some what that makes less sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when you when you land in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh in like japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depending on which airport you land like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the ad is like stuffy or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when i landed in san francisco i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like [ __ ] this s </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sucks like i'm breathing in i'm like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my god the pollution </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of some [ __ ] you're literally just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying the same thing you see what he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> smells i'm like pollution level like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tokyo how can you tell the pollution </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> levels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when you breathe in do you not have can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you not like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> breathe the quality of air you can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tell i i can yeah but i can't do it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> can't do it at different [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> airports i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when i land in the [ __ ] country i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> step off the plane i take a deep breath </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm like this ass [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why is this insane it's like you called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> me the [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it literally sounds like the stupidest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> superpower </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when i when i watch i can tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> pollution levels in the air i breathe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> l.a has horrible air and san francisco </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had most big cities have horrible air </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh it depends like that's what makes up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't tell like the air pollution </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> differing from like most cities you i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like for example there's a difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> between bangkok and like tokyo is awful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tokyo is turkish that guy's fine it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what are you talking you don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you've been here too long what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you talking about what are you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about it's like chocolate is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it is not it tastes like [ __ ] bro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> breathe it in i don't like the smell i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're literally surrounded by i landed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i landed in singapore airport and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is a really pretty airplane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it smells like that's why the airport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has so much plants it's the first breath </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it lies to you so you think oh it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually good then you leave the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the plant [ __ ] because i've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their airports that's just full of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> plants and [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's out of every airport i've been to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> singapore airport is by far the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] airport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and i have no idea why the singaporean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> airport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> which country is the best tasting air </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> upon landing in my experience so far </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amsterdam had the best air when i got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off that plane i was like damn this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> some cleaning yeah i can agree with that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's some cleaning yeah see even you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can agree i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i got in charlotte </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like get put me back on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] plane i don't know i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> get me out of here no it's bad enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm in paris let alone having to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> breathe this air </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like that when i landed in jfk oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like you're the new york air </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like bro i don't even need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't even need studies to tell me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this as politically yeah i mean like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what i'm saying you can tell when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get on you get off the plane you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> breathe you're like oh that's wrong yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's the same logic as what god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was saying about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's this it smells different to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it's the same you're always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> biased about your hometown airport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're always biased </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think the uh i guarantee people living </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in new york from new york is like jfk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has the best smelling airport because it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> smells like home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guaranteed yeah maybe i just don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what fresh air is because i'm a city boy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i was saying when i uh when i get the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> train from london to wales like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when i step off the train from when the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> train opens and i breathe in wales i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like holy [ __ ] this is what actual air </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tastes like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's because you're from there though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like whoa so there's probably a bias </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because it's like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's like no it's it's not like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super industrial it's just like there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just [ __ ] fields everywhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because me and me and connor were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> walking walking to the office and connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god this air tastes horrible and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like connor what the [ __ ] tokyo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is great i don't know what you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about what are you on about it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a mega city bro the air is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> forest city the tokyo air is actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could that possibly be the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wankerish thing that connor said oh the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> ass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> tastes horrible am i allowed to get this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out of my face </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just i'm just saying it doesn't it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> taste polluted that could probably be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most privileged thing you could have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> said in your life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my air is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [Applause] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> connor's mom comes to visit from wales </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and he just brings out she just brings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a jar of air </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like just like connor breathe this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what did mail what did melinda write did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> she write incest again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she's giving me uh the air quality what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is this the rating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all right let me see it let me see let </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> me see this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's [ __ ] let me see this let me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> see this let me see oh so phil is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> terrible so air quality index </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so the higher it is the more polluted it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is okay amsterdam </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 69 nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> uh san fran is 31. the fact that we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> got the whole [ __ ] office to laugh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> number 69. you know san fran </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> air quality index is 31. no way and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wales </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is 68. this is thrilled doesn't count </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trolls are [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that's yeah so basically what what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> mailing is saying is that san fran air </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quality is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> twice as better as whales yeah let's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] biased as [ __ ] malian's from san </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> francisco that's why madeleine pulled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she just like came up with a random </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> number no [ __ ] one she's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> she's like facts don't care about your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> feelings maybe maybe they took that out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in some vineyards somewhere whereas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> perfect air but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their city is [ __ ] awful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're if you're born and raised in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the city your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uh your nostril hair is longer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do you know that google it google it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what did you get on the next episode of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> scientology because your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your uh nostrils need to filter more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] so it naturally just grows longer i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get that but where the [ __ ] did you read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i don't know i just heard it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i read it somewhere it's true look it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i i believe the logic because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like that's why darlene has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these massive bushes going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> she's gonna kill her i'm gonna get a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> death after that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> while nabby looks it up it's true but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's uh i don't know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i heard about that i don't know man yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know but there is a research </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is there actually research well what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> climate helped shape </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your nose no well yeah no i get that but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hairs type in one i'm still sitting in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> nostril </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> who woke up one day and was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what i want to i want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> measure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your hairline my friends nose hairs are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> longer than mine these are there has to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> be a reason we need to know these things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't know enough about the human </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> body we need to know everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so we can determine what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going on i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is this like when you were like talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about [ __ ] mouth breathers and all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because like because like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> having no chin i don't know if this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like one of those like lies or not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it could be but like in my head it's one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of those things i don't even care this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is [ __ ] it makes sense yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why are you scared because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you were going to the dentist to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what not retainers but like the uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the mouth guard the mouth guard thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you were just like i didn't want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> breathe well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> generally it's better to breathe through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> your nose anyway just for air quality </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the [ __ ] filter through right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right all right what is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well there is a steady like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if there are any nose hair experts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> watching this uh could you leave it down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the comments below thank you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it would make sense though right if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were born and you're you were in a place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was more polluted naturally it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would make sense for your body </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well like i feel like there's something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> your mum says be like it's a good thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not in the sea right they have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long nose hairs in the sink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't have to trim your nose hairs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> boy i feel like that was a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> tail i always felt like i had long nose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hair anyway so i'm like [ __ ] imagine if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was born in the city i'd be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like [ __ ] tarzan's crotch in my nose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so interactive indicator of put air </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> quality using </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> nose hair length as a rough metric for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just how much nasal fiber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one would need to catch and filter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> harmful particulate matter in aegis over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there but it sounds like i'm right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> does it but it's so ridiculous i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally stopped listening halfway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through that sentence </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah also get that off like wikihow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> also i don't know why i started getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recommended videos about like breathing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from your mouth and i don't know why i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was getting recommended this stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i watched it i watched my other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mouth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i watched it i watched it and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was it was one of those videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is this would if i wasn't dumb as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] this would be so convincing like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i it felt so manipulative these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> videos that they were like look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's twins one of them was allergic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to hamsters and they had a hamster in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that thus he couldn't breathe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through his nose and look what happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his chin it's all gross </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they just showed like a [ __ ] picture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of leafy or something like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh why are you gonna do them like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's bullying bro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one of those leafy and the other guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like well it was like it was like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one had like a clearly defined chin it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one had like a clearly defined chin and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one had like the i don't even know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you call it it's like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not really a chin it's kind of like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> leads into it yeah yeah yeah and that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> generally believed to be unattractive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amongst sigma members </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i love that as well your chin is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> getting swallowed into your neck kinda </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's one of those things where you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like ha everyone i did meet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who i feel like had that kind of face </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> did breathe through their mouth i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it's one of those things where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it kind of it builds on your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your just like ignorance of it and your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anecdotal evidence of it right but then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i saw more videos about it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like you know the more i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it the more the more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is like feels like some kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sigma male [ __ ] this you know what i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean i felt like i was getting fed but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know how accurate it is because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then i start watching videos about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently doctors who specialize in uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what they'll do is that they'll uh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what they do they'll do something so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that when you sleep or when you normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> do it that you breathe through your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mouth and they go look it's fixed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> his chin is [ __ ] normal well they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just like here's some tape i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> put it on your mouth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't particularly care to learn more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about it or check how real it was but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now it's in your head </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now you're just like but what if i do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> breathe but also i generally want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> breathe through my nose anyway because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just the whole of you know when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> breathe through your mouth your it isn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being filtered and [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i i'd like to live as long as i can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so i can be as stubborn as i can for as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> long as i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean like maybe i can become a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese politician and make life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> healthy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> full circle i mean i feel like you do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> breathe through your nose most of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um you can only tell who the mouth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> breathers are because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can you let me finish myself okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you can only tell who the mouth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> breathers are when you're like you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're in a hotel room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's always the one snorer who is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you you know you know sometimes when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like yeah sometimes when you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really quiet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when when you're really tired but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you you are with a group of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mates and you know who the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> snorer is right yeah and it's like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] time limit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of just like all right i've got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally half an hour to fall asleep or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not sleeping tonight and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's and it's not just the snorers right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there are the snorers that do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through their nose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there are the snores that do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> through there you can tell when people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> snore through their mouths yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no it's so weird because like i grew up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> breathing through my mouth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i was a mouth breather when i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sleeping when i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so funny but that's because i had like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> horrible hate fever so like my nose is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> constantly blocked all the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a pretty good descriptive insult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i feel like you know as much as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much as i i i wouldn't use it you get a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> very good picture of what they're trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to paint when someone calls you a mouth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> breather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i definitely became paranoid that i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> breathing through my mouth am i becoming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a male </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember that i was like i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because i feel like i have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> semi-defined chain i guess i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> semi-defined i don't know i i i haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like yeah i did breathe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through my nose as a kid but then again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again it's i feel like it all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> goes on anecdotal evidence you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everything again i don't know how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> accurate it is it seemed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it felt like pseudoscience when i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> watching this [ __ ] pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was enough to make me care even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> though i know i shouldn't now you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made like a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching this yeah everyone watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this can be like oh [ __ ] do whatever i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just doing this just like do i have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a chin am i good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> am i good isn't it sad that we give a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] about chins </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't care about chin why do we care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about chins i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> did you did your parents ever tell you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like like an old folk tale or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to get you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to do something as a kid i don't know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know i don't know what japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things there are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because in thailand it's like one of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things is um if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eat on the bed then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're reincarnated in your next </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life you're going to reincarnate as a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> snake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm just remembering this now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and that was what i was told to not get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me to eat on the bed and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't i guess it works because i hate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> eating on the bed now japan has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is like infamous for all these like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> proverbs and wives like one of them was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you sleep immediately after you eat then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you turn into a cow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh i think taina did something similar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to that as well yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess i think my mum stopped telling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> me these because whenever my mum told me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> them i would immediately go and try them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like i remember one time my mom was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] you doing i just kept </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> opening the umbrella indoors i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i want to see if something bad happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so i just kept opening yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and nothing happened yeah i was like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> nice well that's the thing it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some japanese proverbs are based on like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actual like facts that are harmful to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your body like so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so the sleeping after you eat thing is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> actually has a little bit of logic to it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like if you do sleep immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after you eat then all the gastric </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff goes up your software and it makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me your esophagus and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> damages your throat so i'm like oh okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so there's actual reasoning behind that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's good but then there are some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are reserved don't whistle at night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because snakes will come and i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snakes are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> literally death oh that sounds amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it isn't from the music it's from the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movement yeah from the vibrations yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the movements it's literally the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movement of this yeah the movement of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the guy that they follow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how did snake charms like start life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i could believe they just wake up one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day they're like you know what i want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> charm some snakes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i got a flute got a basket white people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stop stupid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know do snapchamas even exist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i you don't really charm them do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just make them dance a little bit right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like is that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a thing that's like is there a person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> out there somewhere in the world that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like yes i am a professional snake charm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably it's probably a mouth breather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> why why you're obsessed with that word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> now that you've told me it's an insult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if there's [ __ ] psychics out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that can be any job i don't really give </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a [ __ ] i just feel though it's like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like pseudo occupations that were kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of very timely back in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like you know like a soothsayer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right like no one goes around being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm a professional soothsayer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just like saying they're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like budget magicians yeah what is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> actually a suit says like a person who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes around and like tells fortunes and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like tells your future and stuff oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i mean like a fortune teller like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of yeah that's an occupation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sounds way cooler that that's an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> occupation that should have gone out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> business </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it did go out it's fortune </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> telling unfortunately yeah how that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> should still exist i don't know i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have friends who do who do that and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like you're a [ __ ] idiot oh </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's an egotistical need that we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i genuinely believe that we are not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is up to us to make our own lives </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting and horoscopes and all that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all that nonsense i just don't </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> entertaining thing as or like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conversation starter right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's not something i take seriously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i'm like is your life so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the reason why you have no [ __ ] is not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because of it lying in your hand okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's because he breathes through your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mouth </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> that's real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i you know i think that you could like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> your health and your body yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's i feel like that's fair to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean like i think that no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mystical entity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> decided to carve some [ __ ] lines in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your hand and that that would decide how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your personality was gonna be no [ __ ] no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no i mean yeah there is there is a clear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difference because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like there is a lot of little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> things you just don't know about your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> body </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you don't figure it out until </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you hit like 30 or something yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you realize oh we also don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know a lot of stuff about the human body </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have like we're still like barely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understanding how the mind works you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i mean we we're still like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] decades and centuries after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like figuring out how that works but in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> terms of all of america doesn't even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have bidets so how the [ __ ] are they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have scientific breakthroughs yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't believe that you can't have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scientific breakthrough not with a baby </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> call themselves a first world country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you're not having any good days if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they ever figured that out how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're going to figure out what's going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on in the brain sorry go ahead calm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i completely was good i forgot what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was going to say i'm not saying that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they haven't discovered anything about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um no it's just like like part of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> growing up and growing into like your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 30s i guess is just realizing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you just have a problem with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your body and like as a kid i thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> everything's fixable everything will go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> back to normal eventually yeah and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't realize that sometimes you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just have a problem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you just you just learn to live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with it i guess it's pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sad like it's like kind of hope that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't get a problem that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too much yeah yeah like kidney stones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] if i get those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] oh yeah like everyone everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around my age just starts talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their knees and luckily enough i haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> felt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> anything about my knees yet but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lower back pain knees </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like neck pain headaches it's just it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like god decided all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone gets a debuff at 30. everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gets a different one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know it's like the moment you turn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 30 just god comes to your sleep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i don't know i watched that video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of uh what was it </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> i was gonna watch that i i had it on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> watch later i never did yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because a super interesting video i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> recommend it but it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> explain it to me basically it's this guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who uh he got big off tick tock i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he's like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like works in forensics or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something but basically he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uses like the bodies that you know you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> donate to science and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to study things about the human body </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically yeah and uh and this guy got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really big on tick tock i've got his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically just doing short videos of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like did you know that this is this is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> real stomach i'm gonna open it up and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how food is digested or whatever and he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has a youtube channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he literally gets like a real human </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> body that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whether he's getting people people don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in their bodies to science after that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay yeah yeah he works in like some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> scientific research dexter or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's one i dug up earlier it's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> modern day dexter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's nice he's not a forensics expert </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's just a tick-tock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has anyone has anyone checked the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> scottish credentials </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> he gets like a proper human body and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like opens up the kidneys and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explains how kidney stones form and why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they [ __ ] hurt and stuff and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> man i can't imagine something that big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> traveling through my dick that how big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of these are big some of these can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> go like that but you have to just hope </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they break down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in your kidneys like because they just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't go through the tubes right these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ultrasound uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> ultrasonic ultrasonic yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like your kidneys to break it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they literally they literally scream at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it to like crumble </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> essentially screams </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but in worst case scenarios where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not even that works that it's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crystallizing so hard they literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go through your penis with like a pair </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of tweezers to just pull it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah i did not need to hear this oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'm sorry i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need i'm sorry yeah this guy institute </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of human anatomy that's the guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah really cool tick tock channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> someone sounds like a youtube channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just hope he's not a serial killer yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean he sounds nice i don't want any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tweezers going on my peepee </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i i can't i i literally can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> handle like hospitals at all i just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> faint immediately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's why i'm like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nervous to get older because you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know when you hit like a certain age </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to do that yeah annual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> colonoscopy and you're like that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm just not looking forward to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> day where a camera has to go up my ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> late </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hospitals are probably the only fear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that i have that i i think is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> irrational i guess is i guess is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what it counts as well because lots of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bad stuff happened in hospitals right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like i know that shit's gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happen in my body i'm not used to it i </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> anything like that no i don't give a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] about needles it's like operations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff terrify me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's just it's just things entering </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my body that shouldn't be there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah even like when i went to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> dentist the other day like just having </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] loud as [ __ ] yeah yeah i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting light-headed i was like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean that's why everyone hates going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to the dentist because like you hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in your mouth that just shouldn't be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> made anywhere near it's weird because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't give a [ __ ] as a kid i really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i didn't care at all when i had to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and do that stuff but i don't know what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> between like after age 18 where i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> suddenly started being terrified of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not really sure why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i can barely give myself eye drops </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let alone something going into my body </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you have that friend who's had like 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> surgeries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right i'm like how the [ __ ] are you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing this how are you not like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> freaking out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right maybe they are i don't know it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like when my dad comes back from his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> annual colonoscopy right it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it's it's it's it's the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like yeah i just went to the park </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> legit would faint yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how do i tell the doctor listen i'm a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> little [ __ ] bro i don't know what's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna happen like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like i'm gonna loop me up or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something i don't know yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm lucky enough to like have never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> needed to have surgery or anything like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that but just like the concept of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> terrifies me that that's that's one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's one thing that [ __ ] even if it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> life-threatening surgery you know it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like like the the the whole idea of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being under anesthesia just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> terrifies me oh no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i hate the surgeries where you're not on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah or you're on light one like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> surgeries when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like uh i think my parents my mom had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something with a heart and she had to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> awake for it and that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sounded terrifying what yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently i i don't know it sounded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> awful like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently you can feel it and stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's terrible imagine like you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah exactly right horrible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but if you have to have it you have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have it right but i think i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe it came from uh i had to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i had hemophilia where i'd like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if i bleed i you know don't stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bleeding i had to go like every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three or six months to the hospital yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go and do tests just to make sure it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasn't getting worse or getting any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better luckily it didn't get any worse </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> uh but uh yeah it was awful i hated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going and i would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just like a terrible experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because i think it's because of what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the atmosphere in a hospital oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah dude yeah yeah yeah hospital </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> atmosphere so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the ward that i'd always have to go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just filled with like old people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that were like dying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and like some of them couldn't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even like think or talk and it was i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> felt so bad because they would talk to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> me and they just didn't understand they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scared the [ __ ] out of me i was like 13. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah yeah i was like oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not jesus yeah because it's like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's that like glimpse into a possible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> future </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh [ __ ] i could be like that one day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and the smell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they're talking about smells </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hospitals do definitely have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> distinction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh those are even like thinking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the smell makes you uncomfortable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what i hate about the dentist as </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> was like what is this mythical hospital </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> i saw it as i was leaving i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> next time i'm coming i'm gonna play it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and someone [ __ ] stole the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> controllers so they had a game shoot a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> gamecube with no no </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> that's where you could even buy that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game often like yeah why did they have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this at a hospital </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think it was like a charity had given </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> them a donated there's like a a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> room where it was like it was when i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like 12 so yeah kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but so that makes me awesome some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] rules even worse some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] stole a [ __ ] gamecube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> controller </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> from a children's hospital that have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been donating from a charity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what who does that who does that </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> i hope it's another chicken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna get in trouble i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if this is a controversial incident </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> controversial </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i just can't take that insult seriously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> anymore apparently it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was an insult back in the 1940s 40s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> america </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so 40s jesus christ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the first i'm hearing of it this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is like this is like if i taught you the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> word blessing you found out it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> racist or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] i've been saying the whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> episode jesus christ i i want to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the motivation if somebody steals a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gamecube controller from a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's all it was already a rare console </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the time honestly it's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> another kid right it's probably another </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> kid i imagine it was another kid who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't have a gamecube always wanting a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> game or they stole a gamecube from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> somewhere i forgot the controllers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah how are you like because gamecubes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at that time i think were quite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> expensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were i mean the games weren't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cheap because it's nintendo yeah so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean the game's us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're rich enough where your parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buy your gamecube but not enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> controllers so you steal it from a kid's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hospital </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> that the best chips we have is red rock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> daily chips that's like the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that is the one brand that i've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> since the beginning of my career </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i will happily sell out we recently but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about this time </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> i've realized cheese and onion is a very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like british flavor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] cheese is like the best because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't have cheese and onion flavored </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff in australia dude you're missing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is honestly like the best </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> i never had those people that's a very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like uh like marmalade </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> coated crisps marmalade right i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's what it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that what it that sounds weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what are they called what's it's in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> america as well i think they have what's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it like cheetos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah they kind of feel like cheetos but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jacob minis are sensations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember sensations oh my god they had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like premium </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bagged crisps yeah but these are all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like walker's brands right yeah they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because walkers just like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> walkers is what are they called in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> america again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i wish we had this conversation last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> week when shu was here because i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have another australian to relate to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> damn it people have like apparently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so many news organizations in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the uk have done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh tier lists of crisps from like bottom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tier to like heights oh that's a that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an after dark uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we also had a bag of crisps that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really popular </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was called salt and shake that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a bag of crisps that we hadn't been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> salted and it would come with salt and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole gimmick of this thing was that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you put the salt in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you should shake it up yeah you saw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd literally salt it yourself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right right right and it tastes like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was like it was just unsalted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> evenly like it was the salt would stick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like the bottom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the rest of the sauce just at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the bottom yeah it was terrible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like yeah and it's like if you come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to the uk i really highly recommend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying all our crisps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't really rate the japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ones too much nah they're pretty bad uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the pizza potato one's pretty good yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what i'd say only the pizza </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cheese i don't know why you like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pizza potato ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i told chris i was like uh next </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> just two [ __ ] super british people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> complaining about crisps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's a lot of like meh ones </SPEAKER_02>
