<SPEAKER_03> - Boneless or bone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (playful music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're not eating the
fucking bone marrow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not cracking the bone... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not eating the bone! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The bone does do shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It does! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my fucking God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (relaxed music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Welcome back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Welcome back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Welcome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Welcome to this episode of Trash-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you from the future? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Silence! I'm doing the intro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Welcome to this episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm with the boys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey and Garnt, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm Connor, or
Monkey as people call me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughing) Are you okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connor has suffered from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a major cramp in his neck
about 20 seconds ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - My life flashed before my
eyes, like 10 minutes ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought that was it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My neck was gone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were about to start recording </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then Connor had a cramp in his neck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, "Man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can you get any more, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> boomer than you already are? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is your body already feeling it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you getting your,
like, nurse already, man?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe I'm dying already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean actually like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have recently started
to stretch every day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> after work, like just, just at home, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would go home and just
do like really simple, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 10 to 15 minute,
like, stretch exercises. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did it start? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, it started because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I found myself sitting at my desk all day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or sitting, you know, on
a set like this all day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I would get up and go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh! that's a sharp pain in my lower back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not normal!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to make fun
of you, but, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't make fun of you
if you're taking care of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you can't make fun of a friend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you had a massive cramp (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But as a friend I want
to call you a boomer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and ask you when you
had your diaper changed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right? Like, it's scary, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think, like, I think to myself, "Nah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not, I'm not that, at that stage yet" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I realize next
month I'm 27, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You know what? I'm kind
of getting to that stage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I should probably start while I'm ahead, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to just like fix my shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> before it gets too messed up" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, I feel like a lot of people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when you're just
in your fucking twenties, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just don't give a shit about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, why would you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You never feel any effects on your body. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You do shit that your
body was not built to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you don't realize this, but like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't realize this
until you get, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that kind of time, period of your life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comes to an end, that you just realize, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Man, that's a, that's a really short </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time period of my life, and I've just got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the rest of my life now having
to live with this problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I just didn't
fucking take care of it" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah. Take care of your body. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, if there's one thing
that I've definitely paid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> attention to, especially, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't matter if you're a YouTuber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you're just at an office job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somewhere where you're sitting at a desk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for long periods of time, please, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> please, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Google "ergonomics" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really fucking important, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's a really boring word, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but, my God, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ergonomics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Grant laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like every time I set up a new desk now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to like, make sure it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ergonomically correct. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I didn't realize this until, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not even when I was a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like, like, a year
of working an office job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just my, my screen
was just slightly off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and, like, it was slightly off centered. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had to like tilt my neck, just, just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to look at it, like,
you know, it's, it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's something that I
didn't really care about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until, like, a year came
past and then my neck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really fucking sucks now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You sound like a villain in an anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Me, when I have to tilt my neck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 1% less than I'd like" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey screams) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "You all die now" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is a North Star shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "You've made
me tilt my neck 1Â° more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than I'd have liked to,
you know what this means" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every day it increases
by another degree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - "It's retaliation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will bend your back
one degree every day" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've also realized very quickly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since we have the standing desks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because for the longest time I felt like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> standing desks was just
like, you know, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like a fad, I
was like, come on, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is just like a new
thing that's happening, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, "Oh, people are
health conscious, whatever" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But the moment I started
using them I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, okay, this actually makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so much of a difference" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I just, I just
heard the noise it makes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They go "brrr" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's, but it's so,
I realized very quickly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially between
working here in the office </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and working at home, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I don't have a
standing desk, currently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I bought a standing desk recently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I realized actually how much-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey discovers standing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally did! I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well, actually off the using it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I realized why this is such a big thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and why so many YouTubers are getting it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because it actually makes
so much of a difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like, I'd never,
it's so weird, 'cause, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when you're in,
like, university, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You hear about these things that adults do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to increase productivity.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, "Just work better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just work harder" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then like, I don't
know when it happened, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then like I just noticed that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my productivity just dropped
because of this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I never really thought about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, having a standing
desk, for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just helps your productivity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're standing and you just need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a change in posture or change in whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm feel I'm lying to myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I feel like it
makes me more productive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like I just wanted to spend money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, "Look, it's productive! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Look, look, guys, look!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Look my desk move!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I'm productive now" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, no, I'm not,
I'm lazy, that's all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Or at least my definition of lazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, I cannot work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I remember for the longest time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just worked from my bedroom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "I
don't know how I did that" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did that for two years long, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't know how I did that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm jealous of people who
can work in coffee shops. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I can work in coffee shops. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me it's like sensory overload. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I can't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's just too much stuff going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love working in coffee shops. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's people doing things that isn't me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's, it's intense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I can't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember I tried once to edit a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at a coffee shop and I
just felt way too, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> self-conscious, because I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the back of my head, I'm thinking like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "These people must think
I'm so weird looking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> editing a video of myself" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't treat this place
like my work station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's too much stuff out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not, it's not my
fucking area, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't rip a massive fart if I'd like to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes you just need to get out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the space that you've seen for like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> every day of your life-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So touching grass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Huh?
- Touching grass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so, so you, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're basically touching grass, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> except you're just drinking coffee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with a bunch of strangers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who you're never going to see again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you not just
constantly keep buying coffee? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't, I just keep buying coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's the whole reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why people work in coffee shops. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much coffee do you
drink anyway, Connor? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Your Nespresso machine is fucking dying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I can buy the upgrade. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey coughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "No more, please!"
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would find myself fired at like each </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking Starbucks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I got the menu at the back of my hand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll be like a tour guide, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who would come to Starbucks
with me I'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, don't get that" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just, I just, I know I spent like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> $50 a day on coffee if I go to Starbucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and work there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, 'cause like
I I've, I don't drink-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I do drink coffee-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - See? I do. I do a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you drink it so fucking fast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno how, like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think you drink it
extraordinarily slow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I drink-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like he's making
love to the fucking coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think he drinks it at a normal pace. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you drink at a normal pace. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I drink fast but he
drinks at a normal pace. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like you're getting-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're like the three wolfs here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's a fucking,
no wolfs, fuck, ah... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Three pigs?
- Three pigs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Three Musketeers? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Three wolfs! (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Totally different story, eh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Completely off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wolfs building their houses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the big, bad pig came out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I'm saying it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's most economically
efficient to drink your coffee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just eat your food slowly, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause you have more time
to enjoy it, because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like what happens
when you finish your coffee? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then you just feel like you have an empty, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you feel like you have a hole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're just like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're assuming my happiness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and my enjoyment of the
meal is tied at my speed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or the amount of time
it exists on the table. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't fucking matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just going to eat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what, that's what I like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I stopped eating it, the joy is gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't savor the joy,
the slower I take it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's absurd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are you a fucking speed runner? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs)
- No, no! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But, like, I don't get
enjoyment out of being, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> having one bite and thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Damn, that's a good bite" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes you've got to enjoy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you gotta savor the bite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't savor the bite? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when it's Starbucks, it's, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like being like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm savoring a wipe of my ass cheek" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had so many Starbucks,
I'm not going to savor it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a fucking Starbucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's why you fucking drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> eight coffees a day or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> your Nespresso machine is fucking battered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> war veteran at this point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you just got back from WW2, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I never knew it was possible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for coffee machines to
have Nam flashbacks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Until I saw yours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm getting the value out of it, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Time you turn on the bottom, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh no, oh no, not again!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm getting my mileage
out of that machine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whether you like it or not.
(Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love an espresso. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't help it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, we know, we know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I just love it, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I love the taste of dirt in my mouth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you not, like, find yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just being like "Maybe
it's too many coffees"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, why would I? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno late, okay,
so, you obviously like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the taste of coffee, yeah? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love the taste of coffee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so why not just drink decaf? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know this is a
controversial thing to ask, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I have to make sure,
I have to make sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> half of the-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If the caffeine doesn't work for you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what's different? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It it does work, but it's numbed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the kick that you get
when you drink it is the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You sound like a drug addict (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm actually on a corner side here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because, I, not regard
in coffee, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for example, I like the
taste of beer and wine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever had non-alcoholic beer and wine? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's horrible, it's horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the coffee,
what makes it so great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is that the first sip in the morning, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just beautiful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's such a kick-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I agree, I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I keep getting
that every single cup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I keep coming back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every 10 minutes is another morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a never-ending morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because going back to, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being able to work in a
coffee shop, don't like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I find it so hard to just work by myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my room sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I just like feeling-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get distracted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - By yourself? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I get distracted by
my own thoughts sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno, sometimes I just like having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an atmosphere where just, it's just people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> doing stuff and people doing shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is why like, I love
working in the office </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now when there's people here-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like that too, 'cause
we're all working though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When we're at the
coffee shop, I feel like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, I'm, I'm kind of it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like that one guy who won't stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about transformers at the party. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like I've just brought something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to an area where--
(Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What kind of parties are you going to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let me tell you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I'm intruding
on the atmosphere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the location, even though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know I don't give a shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when someone is working in a Starbucks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I feel like I'm doing something weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I'm working at a Starbucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I've, I've always
been that person that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even during school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could never study on my own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to study with other people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> otherwise I just wouldn't focus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I used to be, but then I swapped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why.
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I flip-flop between
the two, I can do either, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but if I do one for too
long, then I just, I need, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you've got to
change up your routine, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, because if
you did like a full day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of studying with your friends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you only really only did
like three hours of studying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but that's three hours more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> than doing it on my own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but then, so I
feel like I do 12 hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with my friends where six of it are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, have you seen this
funny YouTube video?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then three hours of actually studying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah.
- If I do it on my own, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like four hours of solid studying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - See, I can't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, even when I'm at home
in my office and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, I have to get shit done". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't just sit down and
work for three hours straight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It depends how, how severe the stuff is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I need to get done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never find myself in that situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - When the stuff I need
to get done is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "It needs to get done today" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll get it done today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If it's something where it's like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What if it's like, "Ah, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this video is coming in like a week" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Deadline's not coming on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I might go play some Apex.
- Yeah, it'll be done, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Might fuck around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I just think there is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too many distractions on my work computer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A laptop doesn't have
those distractions? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When it's like exercising at home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> versus exercising at the gym, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because in theory-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it is, 'cause
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - In theory, in theory,
if you exercise at home, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a lot more efficient, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If, if you just buy a home gym, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you can just exercise at home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can fucking buy, Wii Fit you should, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you should like lose weight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I disagree.
Losing weight speed run. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, when you go to the gym, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone around you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is there for a purpose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or it's just doing something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So sounds like you want an office. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sound like you want to go to an office. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, well, sometimes-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (group chatter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You still working at coffee shop now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or is it here only? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still work at a coffee shop sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just think that that
comparison is comparable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I, 'cause you know, a gym, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your home has more of
the correct equipment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you need to work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have the cameras, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have the mics, you
have, as a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you have everything that you
would need for a desktop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have the ergonomics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Starbucks doesn't have the ergonomics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you know, I've seen similar stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes as a busy man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't get the ideal chair, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you got to sit in one
of those shitty stools. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, not if you go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first thing in the morning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the way you go
in, where you're going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't just-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, so I could get clock
in before everyone else? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is how, you know,
I've worked in a coffee shop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know the peak optimal time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to go to Starbucks to
get the seat that I want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And the seat that I want is
like right in the corner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's got a power outlet as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you can just work there all day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's just perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You have enough of an
atmosphere where you don't get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> distracted by the people around you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's what are you still get the nice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can just Garnt lining up first thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the morning, 6:00 AM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, damn this
guy must really want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> his coffee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Him and everyone else
in the business suits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with their Mac books,
waiting for their frappes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so they can start working. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, you can't go during lunchtime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or anytime past 4:00 PM here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because then it's just
too much, too many people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But anytime outside of
that, you get free choice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never been to the
Starbucks here and it hasn't been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> busy as far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah me neither.
- Okay, but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if your job, for example, if, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the kind of content he did, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't always require a camera, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes a lot of the videos
you do is just pure research, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right? When you're researching
things to buy and you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff like that, I feel
like you can do that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of work in a coffee
shop and have a change of an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> environment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I can also do that at home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That you could do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What I'm arguing is that, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you need something
to be more productive, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like a change in environment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> really does fucking help. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get so frustrated because you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm using the laptop and I'm like, fuck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish I had my keyboard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish I had my mouse. You know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I start getting frustrated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not as fast is how it is at home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can do it way faster. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I see. I'm like, to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get what you mean. But then some, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because I'm too used to working
at home sometimes like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> smallest thing can just
distract me. It's just like, if, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not perfectly optimized
or perfectly optimally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if something's not
optimal, then it would just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> distract me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes.
- I also don't want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wear a mask when I'm working. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, true.
- I just want to be home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This day and age it's a little
more of a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I just don't
want to work with them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like on a laptop for a last few hours, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I have a mask on I'm like
I can go home and work and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> breathe and go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (heavy breathing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To my air vent or my window.
- And go (choking sounds) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can just sneeze. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, also going back to
the gym comparison, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> again, I was just going to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the gym has all the equipment
you'd want your home is never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be as a stacked as the gym, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unless you have a
private gym in your house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even then, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You won't get the cringy playlist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> All of these things add,
you know, the water machine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughing) The cringy playlist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, the Justin Bieber Baby </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that comes on occasionally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What Starbucks are you going to? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, the gym. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh! The gym. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I enjoy the Pitbull that comes
on, on repeat. Evanescence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's when you know it's o'clock. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. They would play the same songs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I loved it. I don't know why,
but also, you know, you get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you are, there's just
so much more at the gym. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so many more
facilities and the all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the coffee shop doesn't
have any facilities. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're downgrading. Where as the gym. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You'll you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the argument to go to a gym
is that you can unequivocally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get an upgrade in equipment
and you also get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> environment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I think that comparison full short, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sadly gone change my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, the thing is right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I feel like atmosphere
is important and it's not all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> about equipment, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I agree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If the equipment was all that mattered, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially when it's working, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> then everyone would need fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three screens and a gamer PC to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make videos, to make YouTube.
And we know, we know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Frankly I think they do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We know. But that's not the case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - As somebody who used to make
his videos on a $300 laptop, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I can tell you, I need the PC. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need it. 12 hour render
times I find a mistake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck no, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't do that to yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not saying you need to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you can do everything in the
coffee shop, but I'm saying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you need a change in
environment, get out of your house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes. Touch some
grass. I swear to God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it would help you. It'll
help you productivity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It'll help bottom line. You're telling me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you telling me that that
Apex logo in the corner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't fucking taunt you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time we have like five
minutes and you just like, man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe I could play a game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you think can play Apex in Starbucks? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No.
- You can't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That would be a true power move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also, I'm not a slave to work, sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I can slack off for an hour and play Apex. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's nothing wrong with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a break. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Privilege. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want to, also when you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> take a toilet, you know,
sometimes you got to worry about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my bag, my stuff's here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to pack it all up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well you don't have
to worry, it's Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Any other country,
I'd be like, yeah, but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got to decide. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. But it's a bit different
when we go to the toilet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when you go to the toilet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you take an hour
when you're at the toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like you're tempting fate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're really pushing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan's limits on what will be stolen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It probably won't be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now I am five minutes
I'm in and out. It's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No problem. No big deal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But also I also like being
able to fully immerse myself in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the toilet experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like I can't do
that in a public toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, wait, wait, wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't enjoy.
- I've never been speechless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the podcast.
- I can't enjoy a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shit in public. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is my retort to that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fully immersive experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to go to the toilet comfortably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The toilet experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree with you in
terms of shits, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> My god, we're fucking
talking about shits again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I cannot number two in public
because I need my own private </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> space. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't go to the toilet in public? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Number two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a last resort, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? What? Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because, I want my own
private space, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are you doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you shitting on the walls? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's making art. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What're you doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want a time limit to
how long I need to sit on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> toilet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck them, make them
wait. I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I wait for someone
I understand, sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to take the time you
take I'll complain about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Someone takes 10 minutes to shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can take 10 minutes to take a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well he doesn't want
to be complained at. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna complain at him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna mutter under my
breath when I sit down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to feel
pressured, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hate it when I feel
like someone's waiting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just don't feel pressured. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just don't don't feel pressured. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't, it's not a see-through door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't see the fucking line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're shitting, you're
in your own bubble. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't rush the artist when
he's making his art, all right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've all been there.
We've all been there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're fucking desperate for the toilet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're fucking searching
for any public toilet you can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe you're in a Starbucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe you're in a train station, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And you go to the toilet and
there's just this one guy who's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just taking three millennia to shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that you every time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fucking him every single time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't want to be that guy
that's why I'm not doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, there's Garnt again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want to have a comfortable experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I understand that comes at. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Might take a little
more time than I'd like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I understand that comes with
the fact that someone else is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to want a comfortable experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm gonna have to
wait. I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Literally. I don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I will wait to give that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I will wait the five
minutes, the 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whatever it be. Yeah,
I'll be like, ah fucksake, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> why you taking so long? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you know, at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have some very, I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What a big man, he is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What a big man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You have some really fucking weird toilet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> habits that... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Before we start recording, kind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it kind of goes into the toilet, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? And he goes, do
you sit down when you pee? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mix and match, I do both. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you have a penis? Isn't that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Isn't the whole point of being a man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is so you can get your
God-given right to pee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> standing up and you choose to sit down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I sometimes sit down when I pee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No! Oh my god! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro, I got big ass cheeks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes it's just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The fucking bidet's have
rotted your guys' minds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is this what happens? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hear me out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The reason why I sometimes sit
down to pee is because when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you're standing up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't check your phone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For one, you can't check your phone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally 5 seconds, 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, but like for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what it is is that sometimes
I sit down to pee because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes I don't want
to fucking clean my mess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You might sometimes,
sometimes you might miss. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you pee in a toilet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't guarantee no splash back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're talking about - </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As someone who cleans the
toilets in his own house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna clean that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you're wearing
shorts and you pee. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If there's a 30 centimeter
difference between where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> your peepee is and where
your and the toilet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's going to be splash backs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If you wear a shorts,
you'll feel it on your legs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So when you're going into
a toilet and there's a urinal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there, do you just sometimes go to the... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Public? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The public, toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah if it's a public
toilet, 'cause some of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want to sit down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Sometimes I've been
walking around for so long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And god forbid! There
are no benches in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The next best thing is a toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the most unoptimized
way to go to the toilet ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like the, you should be against this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're literally spending more
energy to sit down, pee than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Two birds, one stone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, what?! What
are you talking about?! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He gets to pee and he gets to sit down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I, pee, I don't immediately get back up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm on my phone for like five
minutes. I'm just scrolling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is some of the best
phone time I get all - </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> criticizing him for
taking an hour to shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You take five minutes to pee?! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, not actually five minutes. But, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I play my phone a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Play some angry birds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, some Cut the
Rope, you know the classics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Doodle Jump. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know how it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, you actually genuinely
take 30 minutes to shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think that's normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You genuinely. I have never. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We get to the point
in this office where I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> legitimately go, where's Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we go where's
Garnt and we realized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's been gone for 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did he go to the shops or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No, he's taking a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. But I'm actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not just sitting
there for no reason, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What part of this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can you explain which
aspect takes 30 minutes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm genuinely curious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you performing alchemy in there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like why is it taking so long? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know sometimes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just feel uncomfortable if
I don't feel completely empty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (spits) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need to feel completely
empty before I feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> comfortable stopping the process, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was the fucking stupidest shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes, you're just
not going to empty out, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You just got to get on with your day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're literally going to
be sitting there all day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just go back in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm completely fine with that, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you not considered take- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't have a limit to
how many shits you can take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a day, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you can, if you take a
shit, you get up and you go, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just come back later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - About an hour later you're like, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm bit full again. You can go back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unlike video games, you
can pause. You can come back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why do you have to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the shit only
I can take for the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got to empty out when I can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're not a dog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've nerfed yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How've I nerfed myself? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have that feeling right
where I'm not fully empty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, yeah, Shogun
eye, get on with the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'll come back later
and finish the job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I take like two to three
shits a day on average. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, me too me too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know like I'm just in and out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I'm still full it's all
right. I'll be back in an hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can tell within like two
pushes if it's coming or not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You do not need to wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't strain that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're depriving a
good fucking experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro, you're ass muscle
is probably the strongest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking thing in existence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> The amount you've probably
worked that thing out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is probably insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You could probably crush someone's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> head with your anus, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, I'ma fucking say it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes the shits are
the highlights the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes you just need a
fucking escape from your world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are your okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Are your days okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My days are fucking good, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> After a good shit, are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes you just need to
escape from your man-cave. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just need to go on your Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just imagined that
he's just eight hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the Starbucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fucking vein bursting in his head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta go and shit, but I gotta go home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't do it here. It's
going to take one hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's just a black hole
forming in his asshole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I will do anything
to hold it so I can, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get back home and just get
in my comfortable space. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You have. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. Some of the best ideas, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear to God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Human civilization would be 50% less </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> civilized, if people didn't have a space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to shit in comfortably, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear to God, some of the
best ideas come on the toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not fucking crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, go on, listen,
if you spend the majority </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of your day the toilet, yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Most of your ideas are
going to be on the toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So that's where that's
coming from, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All I'm saying is the toilet
is just a comfortable place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with zero distractions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You're just free with your own
thoughts and the only place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that really, the only place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds like you voluntarily
put yourself in prison for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 30 hours a day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Also it's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How much more chaotic is your
other explosions happening in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your room? Like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How much more relaxing could it be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to your own room? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's two spots that you
just can't take away from me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> My fucking toilet where I shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And my shower where I can take
40 minutes showers as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 40 minutes showers! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This man's morning routine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know how you have this
influencers who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get up at 5:00 AM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to do all the shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt's like, I get up at
5:00 AM, I take a shower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 7:00 AM I take a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 9:00 AM I'm ready to work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's literally his start to his day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, after that 40 minutes you have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most productive
hour of your life, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear to fucking God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 40 minute showers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Dude, Africa would be
a first world country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if you didn't take showers
that long. Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - (beatboxing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bokksu! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What up? It's your boy, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why am I excited, you ask. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> Even though the word
potage is a French word. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> quite unique to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> Thank you to Bokksu for

<SPEAKER_01> Back to the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So there's one thing in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as well that I fucking despise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know I can't have this hazard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there's this thing that you
could buy and I've never seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if it's a
thing elsewhere in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can buy, like these
are cushioned toilet seats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can buy cushions
to go on your toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's probably the most vial
thing I've ever experienced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And Garnt and Sydney fucking bought one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Don't group me in there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, explain yourself! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not explaining myself
because you know, sometimes when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to a house, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you can tell who
the single people are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And you can tell who the
people who are either it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> women's room or it's like, a couple. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know any guy in the
world who would actually buy a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fluffy thing to place on their toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a fluffy carpet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on your toilet seat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where you put your sweaty butt cheeks on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a hot summer's day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've gotta sit on this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Garnt's cheeks, he's
been there 40 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with the amount of fucking hours he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sitting on a hard surface. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He probably needs to
fucking cushion his ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could probably replicate Garnt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the DNA in that carpet on the toilet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Make a clone of Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To me it's so disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want fabrics near a toilet bowl. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's worryingly close to the butthole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't like it either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is there a reason why it was purchased? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - (sighs) I don't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you push back at all?
Were you like no Sydney? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, I woke up one
day I went to the toilet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, Sydney,
what the fuck is this thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> living on our toilet seat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I tried to get it
off, but it's glued on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so bad! I hate it so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sure, in the winter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe I can understand the purpose of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't want a cold
toilet seat. I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not that good, but it is the most - </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Heated toilet seats were
invented for a reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is most disgusting thing in summer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To have to sit on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It also, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's not even my toilet
and I go to Garnt's house and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when he's gone to the toilet, I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck, fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this feels like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they designed the
homeless benches to be so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't sleep on them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It felt like it was like a
toilet seat designed so no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one would be insane enough to shit on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would you want to rub the carpet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that Garnt's put his ass cheeks on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Into your ass cheeks! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So disgusting, of course Japan
with carpet or something like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's one of those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, gross. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't need it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know when I go to your house next, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's going to be gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry to call you out Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean there are - </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or out of spite, she's going to put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> another one on top of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's extra thick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Double decker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Double that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, there are just certain items, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which you would never just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there were certain items I would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> find that you would just never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> see in a guy's place or just the guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a bachelor pad, for example. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't trust any guy
who buys candles, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I buy candles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you buy candles? Do you actually? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Scented candles? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love candles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's wrong, I love candles, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They're great stress relievers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean they're great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How so? Wait, wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You buy candles cause
you like baths, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love baths. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, that's the reason.
That's the fucking reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't, I'd say I take a shower, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just a shower without a bath combo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe once a month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just bath every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So how often, do you use your candles? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - My candles. Well... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Right now, obviously 'cause been moving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't really even using them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd say normally. I used to
light it like twice a week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Twice a week? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Twice a week? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you have one for each room or..? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, just my office. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, just your office, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't really want it near my bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't trust it. It might just spill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like having a nice scent in my room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's just something
about candles and just having an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> open flame somewhere in your room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That just makes me really uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, fucking Aki puts
all 8 fucking candles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> throughout the house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everywhere I look is a fire hazard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, I know. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just (panting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never put a candle in
a room that I'm not in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I would never do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd never light a candle
when I'm not in the room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I get scared shitless
when I'm working all day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I go to those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We live in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, go to the beach. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The earthquake could shake these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I go the bedroom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's like 3 candles
lit up and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what do you want this room to smell like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. When you, when you go to bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. It's fair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But not when you're not in the
bedroom, it's just dangerous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it smells good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't get me wrong. But
it's like, one is enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - When did you start buying candles? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't know, I got really into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I used to go on like a
candle subreddits for candle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> recommendations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, wait, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I swear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This has happened in the time
period that I started to know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you 'cause I've been to your
place and I've never seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a candle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really into it in London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I had like four candles
in my bedroom. It's a. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it fucking Xena
that got you into it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, I was the candle guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You were the candle guy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was all me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I bought one candle at a store
one day and I thought this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good, but it could smell better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I looked for a
scent that I thought would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better. And I found one I liked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I started learning what
gives a good, a good scent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, a lot of them
don't really do good scents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you sniff it and like
floral ones and like grassy type </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> smells, they don't fucking do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like when you, when you burn that shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not going to last. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a few that
like the really strong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fruit ones, like cherry
and stuff that will stay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in your room for like a week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just want to know okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you got into candles
for the scents, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why not buy one of those
something that's not a candle? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I do try the - </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the air freshener. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, there's air fresheners. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They don't do shit. Air fresheners suck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes they do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No they don't, they don't do anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They do, some, a lot
of them do a better job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you've had the Chad candle, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't go back to
the beta air freshener. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, incense is a good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking love, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fuck with incense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You're a fucking monk! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, wait, wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry, I forgot the different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Incense are the ones you burn, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's like the stick that - </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are the water,
the oil soaking ones? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What are they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, they're both incense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they're both incense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They're different types of incense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So the burning ones
are good as well. Okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The burning ones are good
for, if you need an instant hit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> If you just need to make the fucking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Shut the fuck up, Ashley. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Scent! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, you're totally right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The incense sticks when you burn them are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> much better for like an instant, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you want to cleanse the room, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you want a nice clean scent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, and you say smoke. It's not smoky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's got a nice charred scent
to it that really helps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's very relaxing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's very relaxing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can see why, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> every fucking massage place has one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I like the, I find
that the oil ones are very good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you want to have a 24 hour one for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like maybe two weeks, tops. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the oil ones are the best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like a lot of guys
don't really consider scents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have one put in every room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The only reason I did was
because I started dating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> someone. And then I'm
just like, mm, this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually smells, actually
make the room feel good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who fucking knew, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have one in my living
room, bedroom and office. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Cause I wanna have, I
wanna have every room center. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I'm just like, why, why use candles? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And when you have the oil
sticks or the incense? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because candles are aesthetic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Candles or more of a, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you really want to feel
like you're relaxing the flame </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> along with like a fireplace it's it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a safe fireplace. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't get a fireplace in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So the next best thing is a candle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And candles don't make, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm stressed as fuck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I see a can an open
flame next to the carpet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are you kidding me? Like in
Japan, if earthquake in years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> buh-bye so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Trim the wick to the right size. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Make sure it's not
burning too aggressively. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Make it burn slowly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck are you talking about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had like specific
scissors for trimming wicks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, cause I used to buy big
candles, never trimmed them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - How am I just finding out about this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just like candles in it. It's nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not a big deal. I just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For a guy it's a big deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So occasionally I'd buy, like
there was a Yankee candles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like the that's like,
I've just gotten into candles, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> candles, these are basic candles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
This is a baby's first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you really about
to gatekeep candles? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was, honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's a candle connoisseur. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Yankee candles that you get, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a very artificial scents and you get like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can get like big ones and
you get like a good value for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money. But the problem is, is
that because they're so big, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this fucking big, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> After like one week or
two days of using it, the. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (mumbles) tunnels down, that's
a candle term by the way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tunneling, you wouldn't
understand if you went into it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like so it goes right
down and you have to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but depending on how you burn it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't just keep burning it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Otherwise it will just dig
down. So you have to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to be smart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you buy like custom made candles? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really like them. When you go to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was some candle stores
in London that is really nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> candles, really expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But man, the scents are so nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And you would get like really
nice spreading scents a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I said, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say half of the candles
out there like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can get an Amazon. Don't do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just burn and then you're
like, I can't smell shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? Like the scent should be strong, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but not last too long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I'm part of the incense master race. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Both have their place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nothing to me can beat an incense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And to me, candles are
just like the middle child. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wonder why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Garnt's in the dictionary like
incense, I like these two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is one of the
most surprising tangents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've ever gone on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I swear I mentioned
I like candles before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you've never, you've never, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why we're freaking out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Neither on Trash Taste or in real life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is real life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's great. You know, you can, I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> easy to buy gifts for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can just buy me a nice candle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wish I fucking knew knew
that I just got a nice candle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause every time I'm like, "shit well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he has everything Jojo related. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally can't get
him anything anymore." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But now I know you like candles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll just give you a fucking candle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Give me an expensive camera. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But now you have to get a
candle that impresses him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't get me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't like candles that
are like carved into shapes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a load of nonsense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're just tacking on value
to get me a good candle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? Like I just, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, that's a, there's a
lot of nice candles out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Shout out to the local
candlemakers in your area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If there is one, they
probably make good candles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you guys think
of like scented soaps, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like homemade soap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh gosh, I know you're going to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm only mentioning this
is because like Sydney, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney recently really got into meeting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> making custom made soaps
and you know, they honestly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly, I'm, kind of
sold, I like the smell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They look good. They look aesthetic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The only problem with like
custom made and scented soaps is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they look great
when you just get them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When they're like starts to melt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When it's like a square
block, it looks so aesthetic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It looks great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you use it for like
two weeks and like falling out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like she puts like fresh flowers in it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it looks fucking amazing
until the flowers start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> falling off and falling in the sink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really liked the, like the hard soap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't know when I
started preferring it to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the pump soaps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The hand soap? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hand soap and body. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like the bricks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. I don't
like the body soaps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like it really gets on your body. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it really deep
cleans you as opposed to like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like liquid soaps you get. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It depends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What I love about liquid soaps is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it feels like it just coats your body. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But like the hand soap really
gets in there and you can get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some real nice scents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just feels rough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It feels rough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's what I like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels like it's really
fucking cleaning my skin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I feel like I'm, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never thought that that
deep choice just sitting here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> being dumb, a wash my body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can get like soaps with
like a lamb going off on one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can get like soaps with
stuff in them that has like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little, a course material. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So that even when it's
like, you're going away, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it feels quite cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do like the kind of charcoal soaps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, sir. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kinda like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kinda like scratchy against
your skin feels like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gets in your skin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So you don't feel like
you're losing grip as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you can just kinda like go ham. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because after you wash
it off, you kind of feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a cold man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It feels so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's like, oh that's
what a clean skin feels like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The reason I prefer
liquid body soap at least, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is because just cause
I feel like the scents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stick for longer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I feel and smell fresh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Perhaps you would like
the classic dove body soap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't go wrong with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Great, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just lather that stuff on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In the onsense in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like no limit to how
many pumps you can do for of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the shampoo and body wash. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And man I take full advantage of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, normally it's like you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you do one clean over,
right? In the fucking onsense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like at least three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, it'll be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be like how much
conditioner do I want? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, don't stop, more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll do like 10 pumps of
conditioner. I won't stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know sometimes conditioner, it doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like it gets in your hair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never used condition a
normally I don't really feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's necessary now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but in the onset I'm like
every single like patch of hair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's allowed kick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it gets conditioned and the
body wash I'm like pump, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pump nothing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Pump. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You literally turn into
a Yeti in the onsense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to be fully soaped up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, I'm paying for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's part of the experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They just see me like
slipping cause I'm so soapy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm trying to get on there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> On the topic of cleaning
products or at least there's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like one thing in Thailand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which my mom always buys
and I can't stand it at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't know why she
always buys it. Like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like with toothpaste, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just universally known
that there should be like a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alkaline and it's like
maybe minty you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the time it's minty in Thailand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they sell salt flavored
toothpaste with like real, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like with salt cubes in the toothpaste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's the most apparent
piece of like, why I like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The most horrible I've ever
tasted and ever used at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What, what. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why, why would you put something that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dries your mouth out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm so confused about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thailand. I don't know
if it's only Thailand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just know it's like readily available, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking everywhere in Thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my mom always fucking buys it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I just imagine in the factory like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> okay so we're going make toothpaste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> now put the salt in, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whoops. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Toothpaste's one of those things where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I firmly believe you have to get a branded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> toothpaste every time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know when you go to hotels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have that like
toothpaste, like the tiny white. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it just tastes like you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just put foam on your teeth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, I don't feel
like my teeth got clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Give me some Aquafresh or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. I don't know
if this is great branding, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel like it's just one
of those products that I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I need to get branded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I definitely need something
that I want like a brand that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know as well. That I'm
like, I've used that before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen that in commercials. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Give me some Aquafresh, give
me some Colgate or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Something, something that feels
like it's doing something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Because sometimes,
especially in the hotel ones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they give you like that
fucking tiny little white one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, the white one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's meant to last you two brushes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Could you do one in the
evening and one in the morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That shit barely lasts one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why do dentists tell you
to use like a little bit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to go in on my teeth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're only supposed to use like a pea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I do that, I'm like,
I didn't do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you guys floss? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this an American thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mainly. North American. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I don't know a single person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my life who flosses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's something that
the dentist always tells you to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do, but I don't think I've done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dentists in the UK
don't tell you to floss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless you ask them, should I floss? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And upon which they'll say yes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they won't tell you to floss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm contractually obliged to say yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah. It's one of
those things that America, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> North America just does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly. It's a lot of work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I just want to get
in there, brush my teeth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. It looks clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Haha, British isn't
it? Brush your teeth, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you've got terrible teeth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what Americans say when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell them you don't floss, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's literally just outside
of America doesn't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know anyone in Europe
who flosses. It's not common. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't really see it in stores either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have to look for it. It's
kind of a specialized item. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not just on the shelves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But some people do it.
I know some people who do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's very much of your
own discretion to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not something
that's taught to you to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like a random tangent throw out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like since we're on
like the topic of scents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and incense and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how'd you guys feel about
massages because I don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it's because
I'm Thai and when I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> massage, I think Thai massage, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't fucking stand massages. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't like it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes you get a
massage and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> why did I pay someone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, why didn't I just pay
someone to beat the shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of me for an hour? Like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I'm not
old enough to enjoy them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I haven't got. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In 10 years time. I'll really love it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like I'm still at that
age where I'm just worrying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about every single aspect of
the massage when I'm there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, what if I tickle my feet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if I discover a new kink? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What if I fart while they're massaging, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What if they think my
body is ugly, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all these things are very, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I had one where I
had to like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we have to take off your shirt
and stuff. I'm like, oh gosh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you have to, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes you have to be nude, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some massage places. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just not at that age
where I can appreciate it yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also to me it's like, I don't know, my, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my body isn't like sore enough
that someone massaging me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> feels good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It feels good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it doesn't feel like worth
the like a hundred bucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right? Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I like, I hear
stories because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and this has happened to me as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where you go for massage and like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so fucking hard that
like tears start coming out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People wear that like a
badge of honor. Like, oh man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I went to this massage and it hurt so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I started crying and I'm just like, yo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you paid for this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why would you pay someone
to like tear your ligament? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That just doesn't make sense
to me again. Like I feel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, when it gets to
like my thirties and forties, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> naturally your body is going
to start to deteriorate where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's going to start to get sore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's I feel the point
where I'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go for a massage. But as
of right now, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if my body's sore, I'll
just do a couple stretches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just feel like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, when I go to these
massage things, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though I'm sure
they're trained, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like you're just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're just beating the out of me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like you're just beating
the shit out of me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like you're not
really doing anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like, you know,
I want to question the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the training authority
who gave you the approval. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Like, like honestly,
like, especially like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno how people can go
to massages for like two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like you need to
know someone who knows the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> best parlor. Cause I've
had it in hotels before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hotel massages are the worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just thought like, this is just weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just didn't like this. I felt like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I felt like someone called you up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you reluctantly showed up and
now you're just beating the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> shit out of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like you had no
appointments scheduled today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm the asshole who scheduled
one appointment today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you came in on your day
off and now you're beating the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shit out of me for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm not saying you have to enjoy it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want you to enjoy it. But I also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want you to hate
me for getting a massage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, I paid money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to feel like
I'm getting hissed at. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do you guys feel about saunas? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking love saunas bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am a weak little baby
when it comes to saunas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> My God. Like every time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> every time we go to a nonsense
and we sit there like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> minute passes, I'm like, I'm done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone does saunas wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No one goes in the water
before they go in the sauna. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have to go in the cold
water before you go in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just think I'm very
sensitive or not sensitive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like my. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No one enjoys going in
the cold water. It's awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, I'm not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not talking about cold
water. I'm talking about heat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. If you go in there
after just going in the onset, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when your body's already
at like 37, 38 degrees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fully heated up. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's going to be hell,
go in the cold water, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then go in and you'll be able to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because I just think, well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just feel like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whenever we go to the onsen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm always the one who goes
into the, even the water, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the least just because like, I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't sit or I can't like
my tolerance to being in hot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> places or like sitting in a
hot place for like a long time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just fucking shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you go in the cold water Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What does that matter? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you go in the cold water? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This is important. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you go in the cold water? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I didn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There you go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You go in the cold water before you jump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the onsen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Before the sauna. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Aren't you supposed to
go in after the sauna? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - After, then go back in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, but like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But like sometimes, sometimes
you're going to an onsen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like way too
hot. I don't know, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why you jump in the cold water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me, to me that it's, to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's meant to be a relaxing
experience and I shouldn't need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like, like do a compromise
to have a relaxing experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah like I don't
want to give myself pain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on the opposite end of the
spectrum to be comfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, I'm not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not paying to give myself
an ice bucket challenge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, you fucking do
that for charity, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was Googling. I was
like, I swear there's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> health benefits to going
in the cold sauna after, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> especially when you heat your body up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like amazing health benefits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know like saunas have health benefits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you get out of that
cold water after going in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the sauna as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> God damn does your body feel good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like saying that
there's a health benefit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which I'm sure there is to
taking a cold shower in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> morning, but I'm pretty sure
I don't want a cold shower, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm pretty sure only psychopaths </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> might go through with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or they're like trained
in fucking the Navy seals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Next time you go the onsen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> please go jump in the cold water after. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I swear to God, you'll feel amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - After the sauna? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - After and before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll go in, I've gone
in after the sauna, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that's what you're supposed to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it feels fucking great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Going before as well before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because then you go into the
sauna and it's heating your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> body up. It feels very nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just don't enjoy saunas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's cause in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they sock right in every time
I went in Europe, it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're in the sauna, TM
with the boys, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you chat and you laugh and
you have a good time in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sauna, you talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In Japan it's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're not allowed to talk in the sauna. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's like a,
an interrogation room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one talks. It's just what
everyone's just sitting there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like really awkward. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like sauna is where
the comradery should come out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with you and the boys, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You'd just been out skiing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just been out in the snow, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what the
fuck you've been doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, you talk in
the sauna, you laugh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah that's us in the onset though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can do that in the
onsen with less pain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but that's how
you get through the sauna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> as well by talking with the boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get through the sauna. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Because if you think
about being in the sauna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't stay in the sauna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you've never been in the sauna, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't really relate to this, but yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a very hot room, just a hot room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what about saunas versus steam rooms? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I prefer saunas.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the difference? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - A sauna is like dry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like 90 degrees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The steam room is just like Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> summer simulator basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh fuck that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Saunas are way common. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But steam rooms are similar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Steam room sounds horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not that bad actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I hate the humidity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well it's to get you sweating. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I prefer steam rooms
because it feels like it takes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> longer before I sweat in the sauna. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels good to sweat basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's that's why you sit in
the sauna steam room and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it makes that process a bit faster. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I have to stay in there for shorter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a shorter amount of time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get like a real relaxing sensation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I just can't get anywhere else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Other than the sauna cold water combo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing like it relaxes me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you tried taking a 40 minute shit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought you were gonna
say Xanax or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Melatonin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so nice. If you're scared of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to do one leg in at a time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just slowly get in there and yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like you can't
do the one leg at a time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just gotta jump in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Be careful though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can go into shock from doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's what I'm scared of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just have to,
that's why you shouldn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you shouldn't jump
into depends on what you are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how easily you get lightheaded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I nearly went into
shock one time I did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jeez. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I jumped in and my heart
was like, and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I just like calmed down, I
had to like calm my body down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I felt like I was
gonna go into shock. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause your chest goes super
tight if you do too fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, you're basically
experiencing hypothermia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're going from 90 degree
room to 20 degree water, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like some motors, your body instantly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it needs to be careful,
but it is really fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Just be careful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not a shock, but (mumbles). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some of the best things
in life are, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very worrying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I mean, it's, that's a quote. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like I remember like there's this fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> waded onsen. I remember us going there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We need to go before it closes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It might be closed by
the time this comes out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Like there are some things which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm convinced is just... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We should talk about the onsen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually before we go into the onsen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Awada onsen that's
being shut down in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Should we talk about that now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, unfortunately Awada onsen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is probably the best onsen in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The first onsen we went to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The most touristy at least. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The first one that Jerry
took us to is closing down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not because it's not
good enough customers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not because of COVID, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but because of this weird
Japanese law where you can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> lease land more than a certain amount, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they were
literally renting the land </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and now it's expired. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. It's just amazing,
beautiful onsen in Tokyo bay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it's right opposite
the fucking Gun dam as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's the perfect day trip because yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you go, there
you go view the Gun dam, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you see a giant Mecca and
it's absolutely incredible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you just go chill
in the onsen with the boys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This onsen is unlike any other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like a whole summer
festival area that is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> permanently there where you
can like do a bunch of summer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> activities. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's restaurants in
the onsen and once you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through it, you can scan it with like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this kinda like watch
thing. It's a rubber band. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can get beer, you can get a full meal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's delicious. You can go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's amazing to show many
different baths, an outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bath as well, a sauna as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like there's a salt bath. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's honestly one of
the most amazing onsens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's like a little
outside garden area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can spend all day
there because you like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have you talked about like the
middle area where it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically summer festival, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the summer festival where you
do everything that you've seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in every summer festival anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally you don't even have
to go on the bonds to tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yourself there's there's
like an arcade there there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like good ice cream,
the hot mill cold mill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You can have a full meal.
Like it was amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's a shame that it's shutting down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I don't really know any onsen that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause it's shutting down this year? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's announced September. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think so. I want to go one last time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think by the time this is airing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's probably gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shit, is it probably gone by the time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It might be close, I think
it might be like a week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or two away, but yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's an amazing onsen and
I'm very sad to see it go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - September 5th. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So what were you saying? Sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah so talking about
the onsen area there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So there's this area we've
just picked it up right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there is this area, in an
onsen right where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a little stream
that you can walk through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's meant to massage your feet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's massaging your feet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then there's just walking on pebbles, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like being in like one of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the most pain in your life. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And calling that a
relaxing experience. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What about that is relaxing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't take a single
step in that stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like lots of little like goblins </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and just doing this on the
bottom of your feet, every step. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, this is
not, this is not relaxing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So they have this little stream right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like people walk on
it and it's kind of like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> endurance test, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not like you, you know
when fucking like monks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like test then jurors by walking on coals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what it felt like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is quite bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you have like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have like little
pebbles that are just molded </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into the grounds that just
stick out. And it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're meant to walk on it
and it's meant to massage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your feet. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And it hurts so much and
the stream goes on forever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like 200 meters long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not that long, but it's pretty long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's pretty long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then at the end of the stream, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's this little like
service you can do where you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get these tiny fish to eat
the dead skin off your feet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is common in a lot of countries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. Some people just do this a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thailand has them as well,
but it was actually like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so I tried it for the
first time with you guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I still, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I still might have the
video of us trying it for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If we have it, we'll play it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so rare in life that
you try something and you feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a sensation that you've never
felt before in your life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was me like
feeling like the hundreds, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hundreds of little fish,
just eating the dead skin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like having hundreds
of like mini electric shocks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on your feet. And I remember
when I first felt it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it felt like the most
uncomfortable thing I'd ever felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before. Cause I'm just like,
what is this sensation? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never felt this before ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a service actually that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I found in Okinawa the last
time I went because there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another one in like a
mole in Okinawa, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they had the little fish, so I did it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I think it feels
really fucking nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the guy was like, oh, there's a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you go down the road,
there's a service we can get, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can do that with your whole body. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can literally
submerge your entire body </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the way up to your
neck and just stand there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And the fish will just
eat your whole body. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you do it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> . No, I didn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I wasn't doing it. But I was
like, I kind of wanna watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There are certain areas of
my body that I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want fish coming
anywhere near this man, eating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the skin off this part, no, thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe we probably wear pants
and stuff like that so that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, your privates are
kind of covered up, but still. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would hope so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Could you imagine like
a little fish just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> getting like under your arms
and on your back and shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The nipple man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like probably like one
of those nipple connectors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You probably have to
wear like nipple pads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wear a bra. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah wear a bra or
something, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They'll like sneak in through probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you guys ever had like
a spa day or like gone to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spas willingly by yourself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I haven't gone by myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - By yourself? Have you been by yourself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, sometimes you go to a hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like Sydney just
goes for like a spa day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really like spa
days because that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like three hours of my life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I could be doing
relaxing, doing something else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Self care Garnt, self care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it self-care though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much more of a benefit does it do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like health wise you're ranking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Or is it just like a mental thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stress is a big killer, right? So. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I mean, is
it purely a mental thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a mental de-stress, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but like having your body
like beaten up or massaged </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not relaxing for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some people it's very
relaxing to have that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I tried it once actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we was staying at a
hotel with hockey and now he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, come on, just try
it, just try it once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, all right, fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll try once. I wasn't, it
was like three hour course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, fucks sakes that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three hours of my life gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, all right, you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't do that again.
But that was relaxing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that was my blood
pressure until I see the price, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how much, 400 bucks? Fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The stress comes rising up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Another reason why I
don't like doing spa days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well ours came with the deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh. So it was like, oh, it's free. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck yeah I'll do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's good. But like if I had
to pay 400 bucks for it, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could never dedicate more
than an hour to something to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing something that's meant
to be, I guess, relaxing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I didn't even experience
like two-thirds of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I was asleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally woke up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I literally fell asleep while
they were giving me a massage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then two hours later
they were like, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, oh good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That was a great experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did fall asleep at
a massage once actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't remember
anything that happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well clearly, you were asleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you were asleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just felt like I
wasted money cause I just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fell asleep and woke back up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. But like, I mean,
that's kind of the point, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Either you fall asleep or you
get beaten the shit out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and apparently you feel better afterwards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I don't want
to fall asleep. I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't remember
anything. Was it worth it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno. I don't really feel more relaxed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I just slapped in middle of the deck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You could have done that
in your hotel bed, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I prefer to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I prefer just browsing my
phone because the thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about spa days is that you're
kind of forced to do nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you want to do on vacation? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you want to do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's your ideal vacay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we've said this before, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But I just don't want to do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just want to sit in my room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like that a lot of the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want days where I explore, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I also want days where I
just sit in the room and do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I appreciate the rooms
facilities and just relax. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - My ultimate thing is
to just walk around town </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just find good things to eat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, it's like the best vacation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't have a good meal to
look forward to on vacation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, vacation ate like four
meals, five meals a day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just turned into an absolute glutton, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like ice cream after every
meal. Don't mind if I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then my idea for it is
like, yes, I'm eating a lot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'll walk it off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like yes I'm eating
a lot, and I like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's vacation. I will. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I remember in the
camping trip that we went on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember like the first
night. So the first, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first time we went
to, we went camping. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was typhoon. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like we got there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, we really tried to camp, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were just like, wait, wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're like fuck it, a little
bit of rain never hurt anyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We'll try. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We get there, it's fucking typhooning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a full on monsoon,
the campsites flooded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The tree is like 90 degrees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And Naby wearing his
jury camp shirt. Just goes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guys, I don't think we can do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wish it was a special so
that we could film it in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> comments, be like, nah, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just get your fucking ax out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and start putting the tent down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You could have done it,
mate stop being bitches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. So we find this
camp to go to and you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a decent enough little camp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How can you complain, it
had an onsen and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until the point that
we needed to figure out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what we were going to eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, cool, I'm on holiday. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We're going to, we're going
to find out, we're gonna, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna find a restaurant. Right guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But unfortunately we
didn't have lunch. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was like, it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this was like this awkward time period of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's how you can tell you
were raised in cities only, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you just didn't have to
worry about where you were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> eating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Cause we got there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like an awkward time
because none of us had had lunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like about
three, about three o'clock. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. So it was too late for lunch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but too early for dinner.
So we were just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's get a little snack
at the comedy, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And so we, we walk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we walk 15 minutes to like
the nearest comedy is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it was 10 minutes
and we were just like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's buy some drinks and
just buy some snacks. And, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I remember thinking, cool, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is just going to be a
quick lunch. It's a, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're just going to get some
snacks and then we'll go to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant later. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. And then I remember,
I remember on our way back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. We were just, I was just remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guys had gotten like a full
on meal and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, oh, we're going
out to the restaurant again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. We're going to find
a restaurant for dinner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. And it was just that pad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> may meme asking mannequin where, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when we get back to and hotel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when everyone starts eating and
everyone's like full and I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just like, we're going to
go out again for dinner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then it finally hit Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you heard just the
crack of the beer can open. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, all right we're not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I was ready to, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a great time with
the boys and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I was ready to rate
that trip zero out of 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like this is vastly.
Someone did not prepare, well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this should have been a
conversation that happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, are we
having dinner or not? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are we doing it now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Are we getting Campini
because this feels like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone fucked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone definitely fucked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you know, the moment
we, it was like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 1:00 PM, I'm like, all
right, now I have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think about dinner, but what are we doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look I had a great fucking camping trip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I won't forget, day one of my holiday </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had (mumbles) for dinner, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (mumbles) for dinner on my holiday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we fell asleep at like 8:00 PM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Correction, correction,
Joey fell asleep at 8:00 PM. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I got shit faced. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I had like seven beers
in the span of an hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, I'm on holiday, whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He cracks open the beer
and I'm ready for dinner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I see Joey's feet and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joe, we're going for dinner, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey's just having a snooze right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah because Aki legitimately thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had died because I just
fell asleep at eight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, why is he
not responding to my text? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, I'm on vacation, don't text me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was a great first day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a great first day.
Had a good talk with the boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But my God there's a hole in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I will never forget. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the problem is as well that like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the restaurants were
also closed because it was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was a public
holiday when we went. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like all the restaurants,
at like 4:00 PM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the restaurants are closed
and I'm like, well fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah well you can't
count on a restaurant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There's never any restaurants. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well now we know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have to be very lucky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now we know for next time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you get a Tesco meal deal? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe one day in advance or,
you know, make your own food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just gotta book a family Mart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Camping in like England should assume </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you make your own
foods like that's a given. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, we were going to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Until it started fucking typhooning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - In the car man, you
gotta do what you can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You can just start firing a
car. No, one's gonna notice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's their problem, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You got insurance on the car. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If it's a bit smoky,
don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I want to smoke some meats in my car, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm smoking some meats, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if it's a rental
car, that's not my car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yes, don't smoke meats
in a car, that is a joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You shouldn't smoke in the car. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. And Abby showed us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh shit, why did I do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So there's something about
going out to the UK and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Australia, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think we've talked
about this briefly before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's the first time I've
ever had a culture clash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or a culture shock, I should say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's always related to, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever you go on a trip
with some people from another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> country and you got to decide
how much alcohol are you going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to buy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because for us, it's like you get such </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a weird spectrum depending on who you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> go with. You just never know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But for some reason, with
Brits and Australian, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's always like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you always have like an
agreed amounts that everyone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone should, like, we should buy more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The way you do it in the
UK is, what is a reasonable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amount of beers you would drink
in a day and add 50% more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then that's your portion of the beers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe someone drinks a little
more than they expected. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe you'd think more
than expected. If not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you have more for tomorrow
that will never go to waste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so buy more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause like the first time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time this ever happened
to me when I was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> shocked. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Well it's cause like, you
know, I understand when, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, some people don't
want to drink alcohol. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's completely fine. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's I'm just like cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the first time he actually
surprised me was I was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was my first American
convention and we were going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hang out at a friend's place. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just a group of us
and it was me and one other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, we should
get some beers for back home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just, and he's just
like, great, good idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need a beer. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we go to the fridge. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I go in and I take out a
six pack of beer as you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. Of course you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're going to take some
beer back for home, of course, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then you take a six pack
of get some extra. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he follows me, walks in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grabs a single can of beer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I just look at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just look at him and
I just go what's that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He goes, that's my drink for the night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are we drinking? Or are we drinking? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought we were going to
drink alcohol. And he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you drinking or are we sitting
here? He was like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we are, we were drinking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, how long is
it going to last you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, oh no, this, this
is my drink for the night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I say I could go for a beer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't mean a single beer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was just like, yeah, we
were going to go for a beer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. Who stops at a single beer? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do I need to be more specific? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I could go for a six pack of beer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I remember the second
time this happened to me was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> camping trip, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you remember when we... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so in camping you have one
opportunity to buy everything you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> need for the night. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that shopping trip, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you got to think about the
entire stay that you're there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. Cause you're
not gonna have another, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> another opportunity. Cause we weren't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we weren't exactly in the city, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the shops now are only
open for a certain set amount. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's like 40 minutes away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So we're getting the food
and everyone agrees, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do we have enough food? Oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe you should get
some more food. And like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we fill up this shopping
cart for the food, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the alcohol
discussion comes along, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's me, Joey and Luke
who's from Northern Ireland. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you know, we were
just like, let's get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's get a crate of beer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And how many people
were on the trip? Again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There were like six of us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was six of us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like a single crate of beer in my mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a single crate of beer to last six people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many beers were in this crate? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 24. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 24, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's a 24 pack of beer,
now a 24 pack of beer to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for six people is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not enough beers to last
the entire day potentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like the nights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If we're camping, we're
probably day drinking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly, that's like on
average four cans of beer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> per person, that's not going to last. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At least 330 mils as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah like the standard cans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah that's too small, far too small. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's two pints each. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not going to be enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I grabbed a single pack of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a pack of beer with the
assumption that, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is where we start. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I was going to put
it on the shopping cart and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause we all agreed that we
were going to drink this trip, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by the way, it was something
that we all agreed to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember I bumped into Eto, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And he sees the pack of
beer and he's like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll go for a hard night, are we? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what the fuck this is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the minimum. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is what, this is the start. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the start. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember going to the shopping
cart and I remember putting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the pack of beer on there and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm getting more now. So we
were getting more right guys? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone's like, oh no, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when he said that
I did like the Family Guy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like slow head, turn off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So after that, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I take Joey and Luke to a
corner and we're like emergency </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> meeting guys, emergency meeting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think we've got
enough alcohol with us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So we're like, well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we kind of don't want
to look like alcoholics, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in front of our mates. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So let's not buy another
pack of beer, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's just, let's just
buy some spirits, wine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Let's get like some boxes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you're with a crowd
or you're like, ah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to scare them.
I'll just get a spirit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The bottle doesn't scare them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they see like the
mountains of beer cans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like, oh God. Oh God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a hard night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you know, when in
reality it's probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one bottle of Smirnoff, or half a bottle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What party animals we are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How long did the 24 crate last you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like three hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you run out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If we didn't buy another one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We ended up buying another one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was mostly me, Joey and Luke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd say between three people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe a 24 pack is good enough
for a full night drinking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> starting early, eating
and drinking all night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And what I've realized is
that how you need to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> decide on like the alcohol amounts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whenever you hang out with
someone new, it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's an alcohol amount
for Brits and Aussies and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know, anyone from the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then there is just everyone
else with the exception of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, unless there is an exception, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I always bring way more than I need, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because someone's gonna
drink way more than they said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were going to
drink. It always happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there's nothing worse
than it being like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 9:00 PM, like you're in front of the fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then someone goes, "Hey,
can I get another beer?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's no beer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah cause like a lot of people... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's no worst feeling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like to me that's just second nature. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause like, I think you
need to buy more alcohol </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> than is needed because nobody
likes running out of alcohol </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you want to drink more, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like the worst, God
I sound like an alcoholic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, you want to be the
bro who provides for the team. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, oh you run out of beers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you brought your own? Bro, I got a few, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> come grab, go grab one bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't worry about it. And I've just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've just kind of realized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hanging out with people
with different cultures. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that's the weird part
because normally everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> keeps asking for more and
then you got to a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you maybe run out and some
people are just completely fine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I am at like peak
tipsy, I'm in the buffer zone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I do not wanna run out of beer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I get fully sold before I sleep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to sleep like shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I need this buzz to keep going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I need this buzz until I fall asleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Otherwise I'm fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like shit. I wake up
in the morning feeling awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Help me out, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to down a
bottle of water or two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I go to bed, I'm gonna feel great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, that's
the alcoholics anonymous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just how it is when you're, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're from Britain or Australia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think Americans don't
understand how ingrained </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it is in the culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I feel it further accentuates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're on a camping trip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know what it is about
sitting around a fire where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like, "man
I need some alcohol." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Camping is, you know,
there's a reason why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's considered one of
those manly activities. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And because manly activities
are normally judged by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> either how intensively they are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how intensive they are physically
or how much beer you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drink during that activity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fishing is considered a
very manly sport because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can drink beer the whole
time while you're doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna say it. How the can
you enjoy these activities </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're not drinking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hanging out with your
friends camping, to most people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> hanging out with your
friends, cooking shit food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting drunk, very fun, awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause cooking bacon to
a char and then giving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it to your mates and being
like bon apple teeth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that's amazing when you have a beer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I've never heard that before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bon apple teeth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a subreddit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's bon apple tea, apple tea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought you just
made a genuine mistake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. Bone apple tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually forget the original,
because I say the meme more, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what is the original Bon Appetit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I always say the meme one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So I can't obviously burn apple tea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've never heard this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's literally a subreddit
where people like have like a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a spelling
mistakes. You'll be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> my autistic guitar or
something, instead of acoustic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It'll be those kind of spelling mistakes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's very funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You should watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bone apple teeth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah. I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll eat like terrible
food that you cooked, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you cooked it with the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like you think about
fishing as an activity, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And on paper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man it's awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's awful. Everything that
goes wrong could go wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, your hands are getting slimy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> When you get the fish,
maybe you'll get a fish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Worst case scenario, you
sit there for eight hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and nothing happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You spent like an hour setting up a rod </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cause you don't know how to fish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe you're with the
expert. He can teach you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you tangled the line.
Oh, it's a fucking nightmare. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything goes wrong.
What bait do I bring? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. What kind
of hook do I bring? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. I hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tying the knot on the hook
is such a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - God, you got to get the
net out when you get a fish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then, when the glorious
beer can comes out... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's when it gets good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's why you buy... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have to buy the chair
that has the beer holder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did that for the camping
trip because I know eventually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of these days we're
going to go fishing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm already prepared. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't pretend like you planned this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I know like, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So for the camping trip, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey brought this fucking
like massive foldout chair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wasn't it like a hundred dollars? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus Christ Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't need that,
you're not sunbathing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't one of those
ones where you could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like easily fold up and
like pack into a small pack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it was like fucking rectangular. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I thought,
because I thought most of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the chairs that I've
bought that like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought it was the ones
where you could fold like four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ways into a tube. But then
when it appeared, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why is it only folded in half? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I realized, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because there's two
giant metal rods that are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> keeping the entire thing
together. That just won't bend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. And I lifted it up and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why does this thing weigh 20 kilograms? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, it was something out of... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a Greek God of this capture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bring me another grape. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, the chair
itself was like king chair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't a chair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Every time I got up to
like go get wood or go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the toilet, someone was always like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm sitting in the King's chair." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, it wasn't a camping chair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a throne. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. But like, don't pretend
like you did that on purpose, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you did that by complete
accident because it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a fucking bitch to get in the car because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we were going camping
and the car was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It barely fit in the boot, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was barely fitting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was heavier than my bag full of all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of my clothes and shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, you took one
seat and took away two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fantastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, Joe had a
great time sitting down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the detriment of us driving there and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> having like less space to like sit but. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Worth it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It has like a foldable,
like a table on the side. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like a colonial imperialist mass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go into your new land. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like the game
of Thrones shit, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt so powerful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh man. But yeah, like,
like food, like fishing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how you can
enjoy without alcohol, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because most of it is just nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just sitting there. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just waiting and it's a weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you bring that Nintendo DS or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just get drunk and talk.
There's only two options. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's the switch now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nintendo DS. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just play some smash bros while you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> waiting for the fish, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's what you can do, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You dig that pole in the ground
and start drinking until you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think you've caught a fish,
which you drank to realize. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We still need to go fishing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd like to go camping
and do it properly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But it seems like in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's not many good camping
sites. They all seem very, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very controlled. Very close together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just seems like a nightmare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you rather go fishing
like off the bank or would you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rather be in a boat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty off the bank and
just sitting in the show, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> off the bank in the boat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to be very active
with what you're doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I prefer the boat. I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You gotta be in a row
boat, not like a big boat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want like a yacht. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why the fuck would I
want to be in that bro? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Simulating I'm like a broke fisherman? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Garnt's head, boat equals yacht. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garn'ts like, "I want to be
on the Louis Vuitton SS 3." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Louis Vuitton SS 3. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the name of the boat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I don't want to be in a rowboat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't think Connor
wants to be on a rowboat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with me either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He'll fucking find a way to tip it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Garnt will fucking tip the boat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, we've been on a rowboat together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember when we got to Kyoto, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I just can't row for shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then Garnt also
just turns into like daddy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> long legs in this fucking thing right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He can't just stand up properly
and he was having great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difficulty. He's going to tip the boat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's going to tip the boat any second now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want to see that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He stood up and he was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like God, please
God, please, please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was terrible at rowing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I don't know
what I was doing wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think he just kept putting it in and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then just pulling it out.
You didn't just like row. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, I'm just kind of like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I'm like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I quagmire or something
where, where you have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he has like one arm
stronger than the other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just keep rowing, we were
going around in circles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What were you doing? You do
it with both, pull in both. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We know which one God's fabbing on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Rowing boats sucks though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really, I enjoy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not, not when the
conditions that we were doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we were doing
it in a Japanese summer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, no nevermind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - By the time I left my back was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my shirt was a different color. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fall is really, really nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was doing manual labor in the summer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even do manual labor normally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let alone in the summer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we were hung over as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd probably hate it
too if that was the case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, doing anything
outside in Japanese summers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just like, nope. Nope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's just, let's do an indoor activity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The weekly reminder,
the Japanese summer sucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're going to keep complaining
about it until it's over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? Yep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love winter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I dunno, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't understand people who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like this heat and this humidity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Psychopaths man, psychopaths. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, God, I felt so bad
for the fucking Olympians. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? Like we talked about
this, but Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Changing the
topic though, like I've, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I've lived
in Japan for long enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> now that my opinions on certain
things have changed some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things, which I touched on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which I initially
thought were amazing now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I don't think are as good as British, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Wagyu beef. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. Remember the first
time I tried Wagyu beef, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so overpraised. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like, oh my
God, this is the fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Rolls Royce of of beef. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the fucking Ferrari of beef. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you live here for
a year and you have equal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you have easy access to
it. And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just kinda want a normal rib eye now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Genuinely normal steak is better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause why don't you just fatty? And again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I liked that you liked that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if you want like a really
nice tender cut of meat, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wagyu is good maybe like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> once or twice a year. I
think if you really want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like treat yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure if Chris was here,
he'd be like, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I know the best places. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're just going to the wrong places. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I went to Curacao,
right, with Chris, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was this stand and
we were kind of hungry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And the stand said there
was Wagyu beef on a stick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like a thousand yen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, no way is that
Wagyu, no fucking way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they had this meat out on the counter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this example meat. And
I was like, all right, fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We'll get it. We'll try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We'll try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so they have this example
of what the meat looks like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the fake kind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so we order it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we pay the man and he pulls
out some meat from a cooler, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's definitely not Wagyu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally like the
shittest cut of a beef. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can imagine literally
impossible to chew. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A dog would have trouble
chewing this thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't believe you thought
this was going to be real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no way we would get
Wagyu steak on a stick for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 1000 yen outside of the, for the cure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mizzou data or whatever. It
was like at a tourist trap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you serious, Chris? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't believe that he fell for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he convinced
me to actually try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What a waste of a thousand yen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We took like two bites and we were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "we can't eat this, this is shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We threw it away. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, cause like I feel
I had the better experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause like on Jen, across Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had that exact same thing
in Takamatsu and it was the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hedugyu beef, which is like,
it's like a higher brand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That one was actually delicious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's cause you aren't in
Kyoto, which is basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's turned into kind of a tourist gamble. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of, you can get
some good stuff there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's so over tourist. So I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gotta, you gotta go
to like the back streets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of Kyoto to get the good shit, definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not in front of the god
damn temple to get Wagyu beef. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I feel like Wagyu beef
is something that you should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try as like a, as like a, a rare thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because what I didn't expect
was how easy it would be to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> access it and you can buy
it in the supermarket, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it fucking blew my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The first time I saw Wagyu beef
in the supermarket where the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> only other time I'd ever seen
Wagyu beef is like at like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking high-end restaurants
where you'd be paying hundreds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and hundreds of dollars for
few cubes of Wagyu beef. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember before coming
to Japan, I only tried it once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was because I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had like a well-off friends who treated, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> treated us to treated us to
dinner once at a high end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant. And I'm just like, oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I understand
why they only give you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a few cubes of Wagyu beef in
like high restaurant. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's way too fatty, it's like
eating pure butter. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. And I realized
this when I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it like hacked
my mind to be like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why don't you? Beef is always good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's I can't get bored of Wagyu
beef. This is, this is the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is a five beef. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But now I see Wagyu beef
and I'm just like, can I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can I just get a normal cut. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of steak pleasing as are
the normal cuts of steak here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Aren't that good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. They're not, they're not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unless you pay like a
good amount for it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. And the best things
here, like a lot of those. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So you get some really good steaks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but a lot of them are imported
and they're really expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, you're paying
an absolute premium for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, I feel Wagyu
beef is a lot like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> getting like the super fatty
tuna, like sushi, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, you can't eat
that shit all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's it's because you eat it
every now and then that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, I don't know how, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if Japan did
this intentionally or not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's definitely a branding thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Wagyu beef is very
good branding. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how, because it's
all over the place in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't know what's Wagyu and what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> constituted as wonky. It's like, it's not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like if we prefecture
has its own Wagyu and they'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> argue that the other one is
shit and theirs the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thing I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the biggest
misconception with Wagyu, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when people think Wagyu
beef, they think like gray, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the best. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But like Wagyu beef literally
just means beef made in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. There's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like low tier Wagyu
as well as high tier Wagyu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. And I thought, I don't know who, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if Japan did this on purpose,
I don't know if like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Might be the foreign chefs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That could have been
foreign chefs being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's the best stuff, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wagyu just sounds cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When did it, when did it become a thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When did Wagyu beef become
like well-known in like outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of Japan and become like
this kind of idolized beef? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I feel like that's
how Wagyu is command such high </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> prices, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially outside of Japan
is because of the branding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's the same way, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think, you know, when you eat, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the really fatty meat
cold, you get a flaw Gras. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> How the they've managed to
charge so much for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is also just eating pure fat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I eat it on my five. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I feel like, I feel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like a bit sick sometimes
because I was like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very fatty. And
it's very, very fatty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And it kind of Wagyu kind
of feels the same off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Convince us that flogger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like a luxury item and
that we should pay out of our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pockets, insane amounts for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> When it barely tastes, it's a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Trek to make. That's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why you say that. But
then like, you know, we, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we like killed caviar to the
point where we made them so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> extinct that we made them valuable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like caviar was never
going to be valuable again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the only value of caviar
comes from the fact that it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so rare, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Similar with lobsters, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We've we've. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Made it, we've made it like lots of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And lobsters used to be the
cheap meat that, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that the working class
people used to write. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I'm not sure why it
increased in price. I don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if like
the corporations, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the working class
officially has been over-fished </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't over official. Did
they artificially Price? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's a really interesting
story and I wish I remembered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the detail of it, but like I know I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all I know is like lobsters
was a really cheap meat until </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one day. It just wasn't there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just to share though
the price, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't really correlate with
good tasting food. I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, like who to shout
out whales all the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, there was some
really fresh, local produce. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so cheap and that was
a mixing and I still haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had better stuff anywhere else
from like, you know, from, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from there. And you know, I,
I don't want the four Gras. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want a nice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> beautiful cut of meat fresh from the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. And it's yeah, like Wagyu beef. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like when I first moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could not understand why every steak, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like they marketed it as
like imported from Australia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why would you import beef
when you have Wagyu here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And like now living here for all like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like almost two years, I'm like, I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to Australian
steaks and Angus, beef's a. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Very luxury thing. Like
there's a lot of import, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of beef from like Ireland
and stuff to here island </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> exports, a lot of meat to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're bored of Wagyu beef, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then just the normal cuts of
beef here just aren't as good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can play around into
Loma with the seasonings on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> normal kind of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm still with a load
of those kinds of foods, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like Wagyu and like flog
around and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's all just like a namesake. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think anyone realistically every, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> every week is like, where's my full group. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, you know, it's,
it's like, puffer fish right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like FUBU is also another
thing where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you waited just to say you ate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, no one is like
actually going to be like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> FUBU is the best tasting
thing of the whole spoilers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not, it, it literally
tastes like nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I've had it a couple
of times and I'm just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, just put your life in danger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm like, this is cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess I can say that I ate
puffer fish, but it's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just wish I was like a dog, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can give them the same
meal every single day and they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get hyped as fuck for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it time for the same meal again? Yo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you gotta be kidding. Tesco. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's so hard for the
same meal. Every time he, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> while I have the same meal
twice in a row and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm living like a piston. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I had Carrie two days in a row. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. It's just
like a thing that we, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we did to ourselves as humans
was that once a point in time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where we were just happy to
have the same meal over and over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again, if we done this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We probably were even as a kid. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember what I could just
eat Thai food every day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> She never get, never get bored of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey again, my man, let's
go put some salt on there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh yeah. Let's go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then like I tried, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I tried like Japanese
food for the first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to try this again and
try Mexican food for the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> time in like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, my need a variation
in tastes has skyrocketed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Since Japan, they could support me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause now I used to be content, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just eating like fried chicken,
like four times a week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'd be like, this is fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The second thing I think
is overrated in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japanese stuff out of
them. They do fire chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Very good here. I think
it's definitely chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I was going to say, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like Americans think they
have mastered fried chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, no, the best fried
chicken I've had is from Korea, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Korean fried chicken best in the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I said, they season it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They don't go too overboard
because you got way too much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seasoning in Korea. You
just get like a beautiful, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> different variations of
seasoning. Young, young. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Chicken is like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's all just that. It's just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the perfect texture as
well where it's just like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> little bit crispy. It's it's it's you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Can't like, it's the perfect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the perfect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Little bit crispy. And
like the meat's not too wet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but also. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's all dry. I dry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just the perfect combination
of everything you'd want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the fried chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So not to doggone like fried
chicken culture in London is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing. We have such good
fried chicken in London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really disagree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why the whole channel.
That's why there was a whole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a whole channel
at one point dedicated to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> reviewing fried chicken
in London. It's so very. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, way too greasy, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're going to the wrong
plate. You're going to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sound like Chris right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's going to the wrong place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because London is so bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We were so close to having
a podcast where we agree on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Chicken and lunch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fried chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In London is only amazing
after you shit faced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's say people who say it's
like people who defend kebabs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, would
you ever think about sober? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You probably have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You probably had a
local fried chicken shop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The one underneath me was
amazing. The way they see some, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They did barbecue wings and
I've never had barbecue wings as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good as this in my life.
They, they were so cheap too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what they put in
it pretty like old God awful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chemicals. But that was amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never had barbecue wings
that it was good as that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like one pound
for like eight warring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It worryingly cheap, but it was amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that was chicken probably
even wasn't I don't know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was, but it was the best wings I'd had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jeez. I mean, like to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the best fried chicken I've
had in the UK is KFC. Like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's I'm not gonna say it's the
best because it is very good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in the, in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They make very. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is very good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unlike every fried chicken
I've had in London or every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> chippy or whatever is, it feels like a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it feels like a downgrade to KFC to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like you guys do
chicken pretty well though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm seeing the UK is by far
the best KFC I've ever had in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan at socks in America.
It's war crimes elsewhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I assume it's just not
as good as Australia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a little bit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure there's someone from
some country that's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, but in, in, in this
country it's better shut up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't been there. So
how would I know that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, we don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't try KFC in every
country. You go to unfold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Boneless or bone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bone, boneless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Boneless. I'm a bone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This kind of guy, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To get that bone out of
there. If I can't eat it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get it out of my face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes I just don't want
to go through the process of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> being like a animal and tearing this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Tunnel with this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are full of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you talking about if
I gave you two plates, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> one of them came from a bone chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One of them came from boneless chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You would not be able
to tell a difference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would guarantee you not be able to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Now the moisture, the moisture is there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's, it's more natural flavor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It tastes, the texture is better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything is better on a bone in chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get the venous pumping steroids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Into these chicken.
The only thing that is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is a detriment is the
fact that is a bone chicken, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's a whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I will happily pay the price
for a better tasting chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then like when you get to the ends, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this does not want to come off
the bone. You have to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> be like a feal animal to
get this thing off the bone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just break my teeth. I. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was worth it for the better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because you can eat more
way more chicken, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause boneless chicken
is just chicken breast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's amazing though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not, it's not always chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Breast bone chicken is yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is always chicken breasts and the meat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tastes the same on the
wings. You know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think the breasts is
the best part of the chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it is. I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is. Do you know what I like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like moisture with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My meat and you can get a
more breast. The breast is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Moist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can get a moisture. You
can't get the moist breast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of the times you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you cook a chicken breast
and it can do your cooking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It your. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, my mans, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> my men's never did a bad
job on the chicken man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was always fresh, but
like, like sauce, container. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I've had enough chicken
breasts and rat out random </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> chippies and random places
where just the breasts is too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> dry. You can never get
under the wrong chippy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you can never get London. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would never get at Chapin was chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They don't do boneless chicken.
Well enough outside of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I'm saying. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because you need to cook chicken
breasts rights in order for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it to be done. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But you don't have to pay
that. It's not even better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Korean places here. And
they have boneless and boned. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Always boneless, always
because this is just better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You also get more of it. Cause they don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't turn stack. Go to Nando's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What'd you get what'd you get? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got like half a chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why don't you get the
boneless? The boneless, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the boneless one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you go to Nando's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, they don't do the boneless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just they do. I didn't
even know they did that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I would've got the book. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He knows. So he's going to get the boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, actually I joke I
don't get the hot chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get the butterfly
burger, which has no bones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I want to deal with bone. That. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is definitely drier than
the half sheet. That's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why you pile on the source baby. Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They're if they cook you're right though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause he doesn't eat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nando source is the only source. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well I'm just like
Chris Nando's Nando's man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a 50 50 gamble on whether
it's gonna be juicy or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's up to the rest of the breast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is always. The breasts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's totally up to the chef
man and how he cooks it. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't need to play it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't need to pay you that gamble. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you just get the half a
chicken off the bone because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know what, it's always juicy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's good. But I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The butterfly chicken
burger is just fine as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is the same thing. And
then you can just toss it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It could be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Better. It could be better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just, I just think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the Nando's
chicken is comfort food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't, I don't expect
five star barn was chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Chicken is right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Michelin star restaurant
and order fried chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've had, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been to Michelin star
restaurants and I've had times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where I just want the fried
chicken more like it's just so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much better to me. I love a
good fried chicken, my son, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> In America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But I feel like there's a
very American side of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look, there's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a reason why soup is
made from bones of animals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? And that's because
the bones contain flavor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not eating the.
I wanted to eat soup. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll eat soup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you're not eating the
bone marrow gone, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cracking the. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't go to the restroom
with you. Like honey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get at your bones. I'm
going to eat that bone marrow, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bro. Crack it open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, like you're not,
you're not even a bone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This bone does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do. It does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God. I'm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sure out of fast food restaurant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't do with the bone
on it. I'm sure it does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If they marinate with the bone in, yes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the bone will have an effect help. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when you're at fast food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they literally got that chicken
in the van 20 minutes ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's on your plate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no time to have
the bone plane affect you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just getting boned. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I rest my case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It does make a difference, but I'm not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not even going to know that argument. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It makes I'm not even
going to pretend to start. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not going to start to
pretend that I think I know the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> difference. I don't do
you have tastebuds Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you have taste to tell the
difference and you do have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> tongue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure a man, man,
who doesn't like source, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't trust a God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have tastebuds and you
know what? I taste chicken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If it's from the bone or
it tastes like cheese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all chicken tastes the same.
Jerry, all meat stays the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just beef. It tastes the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It comes from the same animal.
All beef tastes the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Every cut of beef is the same.
All chicken tastes the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> All chicken tastes the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's parts of the chicken
in terms of like the skin and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause the wing is just an
extension of the breast in terms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of how the meat is the meat, the meat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm about to leave. I didn't say that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't take responsibility
for that statement. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The wing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the meat part of it tastes
exactly the same as the breast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why they can make
boneless wings and call it wings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't taste any different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The only problem is with the
bone is that you get like veins </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and. And then it's
like, I don't want that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Who wants the vein? Who's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is boneless wings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The boneless wings, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Go to Buffalo, wild wings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You at any of the pieces, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all it is is just chicken breast car. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you know that to make it look like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To make it because like I've
never gotten boneless wings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I'm like, what the? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This we've. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Never tried it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - To never tried. I've
tried to boneless chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You should have never ordered it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never tried boneless
wings, but I've had like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Boneless chicken. Isn't
all chicken boneless. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you get into like a restaurant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get wings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But when you get wings,
boneless wings, every time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's off the bone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Chicken is always tastes
better off the bone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's less healthy for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The reason why people promote
breasts it's because it's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> leanest meat, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That doesn't necessarily
mean it tastes better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The wing meat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the actual meat that you're
eating tastes no different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from the breast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the moisture
content. And it's it's you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the bone flavor that
seeps the chicken. Somebody, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it just, it tastes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Better unless we're at a
gourmet restaurant. I would, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would say that's invalid
because you know these, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these fast food restaurants,
you know, and the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the place where you're eating
wings from 90% of the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't going to have the
bone play any effect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Buffalo, wild wings see
a barn was chicken door. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What the is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, you have a KFC bargain
bucket or KFC marking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you have preferences of which one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which piece you take because
every piece tastes different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if, and if every piece of
KFC chicken tastes different, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depending on the part of the chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The different seasons that
you get a different ratio of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> skin, the surface skin
to like meat with the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with the wings, with the drums, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have the optimal skin to meat ratio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you get more skin. So it tastes better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas the big, the big like
flat piece where I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's it called? What's it called? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> The big flat piece. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is it called? You
know, there's two pieces. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's the wing. And then
there's the other piece. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's kind of like a big piece like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You can just get more meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's worse. The worst,
the wordless skin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It tastes worse because it's
just purely meat. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want it overing
on it. I don't want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, you're, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're confusing it because
you're having more skin, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is where all the flavor is with KFC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why you think it tastes
better because you're getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more bite of a skin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How are you not seeing this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How are you failing to
understand this con? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I literally don't give
a. When it comes to KFC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fresh. It's all chicken to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Bone or no bone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This whole chicken. Like
I love boneless wings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I love fried chicken burgers.
I love the chicken select. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the chicken tenders Danny's
a amazing contenders are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> better than nugs and
wings with bones in them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nugs are like the part of the chicken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that nobody else eats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? They've repackaged it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, do you know why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the worst tasting
part of the chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Boneless. Boneless is better than bones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are. You are so wrong on site. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Trying to think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Freedom of speech was a mistake
until I heard until I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heard you speak. You're a clown man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, why are you making it
more difficult to eat this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're making more mess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The reason flat earth is exists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like this is, this is like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Boneless nuggets are
like chicken extract. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's hardly a chicken paste. You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a polished starring
with chicken tastes and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chicken tenders are good. Chicken tenders, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chicken tenders are all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Think we're all in agreement.
Chicken tender is a good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean off the bone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Chicken is always the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's that? That is taken off the. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Off the bone and then
fried and then present. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, because, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because you're taking the
tastiest part of chicken, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> chicken off the bone is literally
Barlass chicken with one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> extra step, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the breast is the worst tasting
part of the chicken. It is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you taste the chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the most healthy have
you got chicken feet? Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Well that's okay. Well, It's the most, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the worst tasting
part of the chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like actually, you
know, having a Scot meat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> white meat, meat on it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's it's the most healthiest
for you, you know, it's it's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, if you want
to eat a healthy meal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you should eat the leanest
part of the chicken, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which doesn't necessarily
mean it tastes the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the fact that you think
that all chicken tastes the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> same, no matter what part
of the chicken is from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The main part of it.
Like the breast the wing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's all comes in the house, prepared. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't, you know, it's
entirely to do with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And how much water has been
injected into it. Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If, if, if you prepare each
part of the chicken, the same, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is exactly what fried
chicken is than the worst pacing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than, than it tastes the same,
then it doesn't taste the, I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guarantee I can take two
different fried chicken from two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> different parts and put it in
front of you, blindfold you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you will not be able to
hold them because press, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in fried chicken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think you'll just, you
know, you're confusing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> The feral instinct of tearing it off as a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> as a supplement for flavor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's what's going on here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause there's no way, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you rip the skin
off and you would eat it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it tastes the same. Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't they just
sell breasts then? Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why? Because they can taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The same. They do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's called boneless wings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean, I mean, why, why, why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why market wings in that case?
Because the market thigh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What'd you mean thighs?
Cause thanks are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what are they? I mean like
more cartilage they're cheaper, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right? Like they normally just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they have more like in
them, more muscle and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The cartilage of chicken.
It's like a muscle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not talking about collar.
I'm talking about thighs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thighs and cartilage. I just said, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> your thighs have more
like cartilage in them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like the like
muscles and it's five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a different part of
the meat that tastes a bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different. So the breast, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The thighs have more muscle
in them. It's a five, the. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Breast has more muscle in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We literally talked about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The breast is the lean
part of the chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the part where the most muscle, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just going to hang back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, when you
bite into a meat, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> When you've put five loads, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like fibers and that you gotta like, oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I really don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you go to the supermarket, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you cut up chicken thigh
compared to chicken breast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The breast is like nothing in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's your pure meat. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The thigh is just like, it's got like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like strands of muscle in
it and it's way tougher. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's cause it's a thigh. It's got muscle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think, I don't think we've ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Been this silent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cook, the chicken thigh
and a chicken breast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, I can't argue that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know what? Like, if
you can argue with an idiot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll just take you down
to their level and beat with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How can I argue? Argue
Romans so many levels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a thigh doesn't have the
most amount of muscle because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not the lean meat. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the breast, the
breast is pure muscle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's pure muscle it's
wave. What do you think? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or would like all the
meat is muscle, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the breasts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason the breast has
the most muscle is because it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't come with the bone. You are just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you have a pure slab
of pure chicken muscle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are you saying? Oh my. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The breast isn't just one big muscle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you think meat is? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a layer of different things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like fatty
layers and stuff as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a whole combination of all
just pure muscle. Yes it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, it is no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause it's like fibers and
stuff that connects all the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> muscle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a muscle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got to Google this.
I got to consult Google. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like losing my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm actually losing my mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's this, this
has just turned into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you, are you all entertained? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I am. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm loving. I'm just sitting back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Just watching you guys lose
it over literal pieces of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm losing brain cells, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how many brain
cells has just died in that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't believe you're
getting heated over poultry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just hilarious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I misunderstood what I
was saying. I Googled it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I misunderstood tendons and
muscles and I confuse the two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's all right, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's all right to admit when
you're wrong. It's all good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's all good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're the bigger man.
You're the bigger man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Worry, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll admit when I'm wrong, I fucked up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, this episode
started really, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this episode started really
calmly talking about candles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> incense, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> de-stressing and ended up
being one of the most stress in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> juicy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why couldn't we have started on this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm saying because the muscle
is used more often than the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> breath. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not only became the
most stress-inducing argument, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but also at the same time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it became Googling it again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it became one of the
most stupid arguments we've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ever had on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The breast meat is the most
lean is because that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> muscle that's the most used. No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the least used. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Audio. Only listeners. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You might want to watch
tune into the YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm assuming melting down over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Poultry only on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't think we could get
more heated than the pizza crust </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> argument. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just, I would, I just
love like peering over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The thigh is a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is considered a darker meat
because it's used way more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When they're walking all the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't using their
breast all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, what's lean meats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then lean meat, I think
is what it's used less. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it? I think I thought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was because it was used. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The most. So here's what Google says. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Apparently I Googled why's thigh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dark meat and it says the
more myoglobin, the darker, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the meat and the richer, the nutrients, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Michael and provides muscle
with oxygen required for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exercise and movement. Since
chickens are flightless birds, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they use their legs and thighs
to get around making first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thoughts darker than the breast or wings, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because you're not you're
using. How would you, how, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how would you think that the
breast is used more than the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thigh? How does that make any sense? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you use your breast more
than your thigh, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was wrong on the muscle part? Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But how could you think
that the breast is used by? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I be breathing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Idiots. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're still wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We equaled the playing
field, but you're still wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You're still wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're both idiots. And
welcome to Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, when the trash is two
idiots arguing over chicken, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I feel like
30 minutes wasn't enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just want to know how you
thought the chicken walked in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> your fight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just want to know how you
thought the breast had less </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> muscle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just did a brain fog. That's my. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Chicken shimmy. When they walk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just hear the like a December music. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just, I just thought leaned me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It just had more muscle
use. That's what I thought. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought when I hear the word lean meat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it means it's got less
fatty content. So I just. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, this one's lean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? They have some
muscles, but not that much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. And kind of have like,
no, it's not worked out me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. It's kinda like not
fat meat, but not very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like thought like I think, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Am I crazy here? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You say someone's lean when
they look like skinny, but yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they got a little bit going on. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Because there's,
there's only the muscle content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're not muscular
though. There's no fat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no fat content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no fat content bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. You've got lean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. So, I assumed that
because it was leaned meats, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it would have less fat contents. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Therefore it was the one that
was used the most. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I guess by that
logic, it'd be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if I didn't do anything and
didn't, and didn't have any fat, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I would be muscular, but
I'm not using my muscles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I'm still like
confused because the more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You use a muscle, the more,
the more muscular it becomes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more nutrients that demand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So how does the breast
have the most meat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and muscle when it then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So when you're working out, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the muscle fibers become a
lot more intense and I believe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they go through like they're
in the meat a lot more. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think if I'm correct in
saying that that's cause that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what makes like when you,
when you go to space, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Your muscles get that the muscle
fibers are so weak because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they haven't been used. So then when they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I believe when they're being
used are a lot more intense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's why when you have the thigh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it bites back a lot more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's tougher to eat because
the muscle fibers are so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> stronger. That's what
I, how I interpreted it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Again, I misunderstood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why lean me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because the breast isn't
really using the breast marks. </SPEAKER_01>

moment when he was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't say it on purpose,
but I just said I disagreed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just like I didn't do that on purpose. </SPEAKER_04>

series. He didn't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
