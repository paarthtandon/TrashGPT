<SPEAKER_02> I texted Felix uh earlier when we found </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out that this was episode 69 because uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> little backstory so uh you know Felix </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would be PewDiePie who we've been trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get on the show but I can't come to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan because you know obviously because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the world situation so but we hoped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that oh yeah you know by episode 69 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hopefully you know he would have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> able to come yeah obviously he couldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so uh I uh I texted him and said I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry man like we didn't didn't he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't he like specifically say reserved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> episode 69. he was like Joey if I'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on episode 69 I'm just not coming on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I remember you telling me that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in like episode two or three or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something just when trash day started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and I'm just like are we even gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> be around 69 like oh we even can have an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> audience by then I was like well I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like she's very very like positive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thinker so we're like thinking 65 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> episodes ahead I was just like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't even like Envision episode 69 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I was just like I'll be happy if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we can last a year yeah honestly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly podcast it's weird to think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that we're probably gonna reach 100 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's scary there's gonna be like which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episode of trash tasted this in oh it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 179 actually yeah right that's weird to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think that that could be a thing scary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because when I see Joe Rogan it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> episode 800 or something like yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but he doesn't he like record three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes a week or something it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> once every two days holy yeah like four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hours long yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] I think I thought I run out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> topics to talk about yeah right oh my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God I like you know just sitting through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one episode of Joe Rogan really makes me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> appreciate just how much [ __ ] A he knows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and B like how good he is at like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stretching out a single topic because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like no but seriously because like after </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 800 something episodes four hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> at a time right like you have to like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like when you're very you do talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about current topics and you very much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but as well like even if it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> current topics he's very good at like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like really extensively like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going into a topic to the point where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know a topic that can last </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe what 10 minutes on trash days can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> last up to an hour on the Joe Rogan show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he's really cleaning out his content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we fit in here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no I mean you know when you're when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're talking about politics you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they suddenly turn what could be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two-minute conversations into 10 hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is true </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you [ __ ] kidding me are you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kidding me like I think the reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people come to watch first East is to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> escape political knowledge I come to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trash day to escape </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like I just want to talk with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the boys everyone who talks about it I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like is not I feel like no one is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> educated enough about it and no yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so when everyone talks about it I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know which level of Education </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need in this topic but I feel that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no one has enough because everyone seems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to always have some [ __ ] argument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm like what yeah what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> going on right like the problem the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> problem with like a lot of political </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> topics is that the trash Taste of marks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh are you gonna drink water no drink or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> coffee out of it sorry I bet you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> asking yeah I'll take the leads as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give me the list no because I completely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> agree because a lot of the times there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are some topics where you know you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> genuinely don't know you don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which side to listen to because both </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sides are just at each other's throats </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like I don't feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time someone brings up some kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of political like conversation because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a just don't really care about politics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in general and B I'm again not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> knowledgeable anymore you don't care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about politics in general that's taking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a stance in itself Joe yeah wow yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's privileged </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like everything like it doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> matter what it is it could be like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most far left thing you could be the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most far right thing and my only two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like answers is just oh that sucks or oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's good I guess I keep up with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I do also really despise the era </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're in where like it's like all like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything is political yeah no no it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not that everything's political it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like everyone has to be involved yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> has to be educated in it right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone needs an opinion I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the main players are all just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTubers and I'm like I don't trust </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTubers I'm a YouTuber I don't trust </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other YouTubers I don't trust myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> across yourself I know what we're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I know for a fact that these people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cannot be that doing that good of a job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and when I listen to them I'm like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know to me it's like it's also been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> highly monetized now yeah like money has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> become such a big player in it that I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't want to watch any of these people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on YouTube tell me about it that's true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> why they believe X person has no rights </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever because it's like you've got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a horse in in this race to talk about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you know you gotta if you've got to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get people angry and upset about it so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can get dollars there's something in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it for you yeah yeah you know you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why I also hate it a lot and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> also just don't really like talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it online because it's it's a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> show and also it is everyone has their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> own opinions it is a [ __ ] show and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just feel like some some things are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just better discussed in private with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the person because there's only there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only so much you can say in 140 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> characters on Twitter and that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately where a lot of these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> opinions are being spread and like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's easy to one misrepresent your own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ideas and two other people to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> misrepresent ideas yeah it's just it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just seems like a lose-lose situation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me too I like I don't know why it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just so bad or why don't more people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just don't just agree that sometimes you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just aren't educated enough or you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know enough about a topic to just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have an opinion yeah and you say that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like you know it's very I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's so many things now where we just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have so much information on topics where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah okay maybe someone can some two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parties can present the same uh the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complete opposite uh argument but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's enough information where they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can kind of both make their point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because they have enough points that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> work with one person and enough points </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that work with the other it's like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well I can get educated on all of it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then when you do try and educate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yourself on everything in a certain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> situation you just you just realize I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just hate all of this yeah that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything is just [ __ ] and nothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> works pretty much there's like the right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> answer yeah yeah I I I've gotten to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> point A lot of times where it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like how do I fix this problem I have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> absolutely no [ __ ] clue I don't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know where to start the more I read the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> more depressed life and the rest of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world is like first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no one knows the answer and that's why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're arguing yeah yeah it's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> whole thing with like the uh you should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reduce your uh energy uh usage to help </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> combat global warming and then it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole thing of but then also like BP </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like spilling the entire oil supply </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into like the the ocean and it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well I feel like I'm like not really the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> problem I feel like it's not really me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah then you say that and people get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> angry and then it's like what and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like well change it we should we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> should we should vote against these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> companies but that's been proven that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't doesn't really [ __ ] work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> half the time because clearly someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> makes a new rule with it that they can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> go in the the whole game is busted so no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> matter how many times you change the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rules it's just not gonna turn out to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the game that they want to play it sucks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it sucks it all [ __ ] sucks it does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's why we don't talk about it it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> always goes to the negative for me which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is why I'm just like I'm on trash taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the boys I just wanna I just want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to shut off the internet for a while I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> want to talk about how I want to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> reincarnated as a dog yeah it's okay to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> stop caring you know this is too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah too much because right now we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just so overloaded with informations and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> things to care about right I literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got to like [ __ ] myself if somebody </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sneezed within two feet of me and now I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gotta worry about what's going on you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know in like multiple countries now I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a UK I live in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the biggest thing that's changed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right because before everyone could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone only needed to care about what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was around them right and now being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people on the internet I have to care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about every thing going on globally and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it gets to the point where there are so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many different cultures so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different so many different points of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> view so many different like experiences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that each individual has had that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes it's impossible for a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people to get the same same like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> viewpoint on things because even for us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who've lived in like multiple countries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and have had like experience with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> multiple cultures like you can say we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cultured ourselves that's like like well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like saying saying this in like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pure unironic sense because you get this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sense whenever I go home or whenever I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hear about any of us going home and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see people who have stayed in their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hometowns and you see people who have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not left their hometowns and they have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the exact same Viewpoint that they got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> raised on right and you know and coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from the place you kind of you kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you you kind of understand how they got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that Viewpoint even though you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> agree with it you know what I mean but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can also understand that they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have anything to really change their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Viewpoint in there because they've never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> experienced it there's nothing there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no like new information that comes in to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like stimulate that change and thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> process so forever they just think well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is correct because this is what was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what it was like around me I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about anything else that's happening in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the world so this is just how I'm going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see the world but then you know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for instance like I remember like when I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I first came back to Australia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after I was living here and you know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would go see like my friends and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that who have been there like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entire time like yeah I don't know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things that I remember I used to be able </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like very heavily relate with and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like kind of almost agree upon I found </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> myself to be like oh is this is this how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I is this how I felt like is this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this really what my thought process was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like and it's like and it's so weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because like that didn't even happen in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that much of a large space of time like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that only maybe happened like two years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I'm just living here and and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think you know like definitely like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing YouTube and stuff like that has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> got me to interact with so many more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different nationalities and you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know doing this job like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> almost forced to be up to date with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything that's happening in the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because you have people all over the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> world who are viewing you right so yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have this weird pressure of being like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know I don't want this like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> person from this one country coming into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like my streams or whatever and being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like do you know what's happening in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> country right now and me going no I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't yeah yeah you get that like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you think about the current </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gentrification of uh Southeast uh Macau </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like what the [ __ ] it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know but I know that what is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Macaulay yeah you get that a lot you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're like you surely can't expect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> me to have a horse in this race please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come on I'm just kidding people from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okay I know I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but like that's the thing where it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know you're almost like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pressured to be up to date on that kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of stuff because you don't want to leave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any of your viewers out and stuff like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that and so that causes you to just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know it absorbs so much information </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about the world that when I go back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my hometown and I meet people who aren't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up to date on that kind of stuff who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have completely different viewpoints of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the world because the amount of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> information that they've absorbed about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the world is on a different level it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's I don't know it's like it's it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> bit of a whiplash yeah a couple of I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> used to think like that that's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> weird I don't even know my own blood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> type so I don't even expect people to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like learn about like the outside you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know how do people expect me to keep up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with like weird news in some country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never heard of I think you should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> be the one to know your own blood type I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should I have a blood disease as well I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have a blood disease I don't know how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> applied as well I don't know he's pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh irresponsive yeah I think you also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had to do like a blood test here yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you got show in your blood type yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having said that I don't know my blood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> type either even though we're the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just as monkey brain as him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently yeah I know it's in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> alphabet like it's one of them it's in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the out one of them it's one of the four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> one is your blood type Sigma </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Alpha Sigma Alpha decaf I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know you know and I I do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know like you said you do try and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> educate yourself on some things but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just like so many you know you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> can't be expected to keep up with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> certain things like here's a question </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then like do you feel like there's a big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difference between explaining to someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you know what kind of your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perspective and actually like having the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> person really experience it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> empathize with you because I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> those are two different things yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know I I can I can sit here I could go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> back to Wales and explain Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> culture all day and they just won't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> understand it exactly why would you why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would you do that why would you bow at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> every single every every word why would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you say excuse me every September yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah to me it's kind of like very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> similar to let's say learning a language </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can explain a language you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explain grammar structures and you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explain you know how how the writing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> system stuff works but there's there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> difference between understanding how a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> language works and actually just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absorbing it and really getting a feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the language yourself yeah uh I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't I know there's a word for it um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> acquisition language acquisition right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is just you know it was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> learning how it works on a logical sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I feel like I feel the exact same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way when it comes to cultures and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perspective where there's been so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> times where someone has told me about a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perspective right and again you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> logically like yeah I agree with that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you you know they could be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making the most sense but then you kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of maybe move to the country that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're living in or you go travel there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you meet more people from that same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> culture and you're like I think I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually get what you're talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like yeah I think it's like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know how you know when you're growing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you hear about other countries and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you think oh it's that funny little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing that country does you know like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never I know like they would probably do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this about Japan a lot they would just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> show things like Superman they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh isn't that isn't that so strange </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's big men in diapers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's one of those things isn't it but I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that when you get to experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more cultures your mindset on on when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you see stuff like that changes a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you go from thinking oh that funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thing that weird strange thing to think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure there's a story behind it I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sure there's a history I definitely felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that especially after I started dating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Aki and you know through YouTube meeting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of like Americans because like in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Australia the image of America is not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that glamorous or like positive in any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> way like I'm just saying it's straight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up like you know like I don't think the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> image of Americans with America is a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of Americans are often like the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people to bash them right exactly I love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you man yeah but like you know it all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depends on where they're from yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depends yeah but like after you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually going to America and talking to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Americans and stuff like that that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely flipped open and I realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh it's the problem was just kind of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> environment that was pushing that agenda </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the media that I consumed that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of pushing this sort of negative </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> agenda about American culture and stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that but then when you actually go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you live it out you see it firsthand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you see everything else that they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't show and you're like oh actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not as like insane or wacky as like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the TV shows or the the [ __ ] my friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> were talking about make it out to be you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know yeah but like I remember when I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first started dating Sydney right I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember we uh like when we first when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we first met and first started dating I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember early on because you mentioned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this to me to me the other day I asked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> her so would you like out of curiosity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what do you actually think about America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and she was like greatest country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the world and I I remember was she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dead asleep no no she was dead she came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from like imagine it she came from like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a small town in the midwest where yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when you first started yeah when I first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started dating five six years ago right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right seven years ago now actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well it was a long time ago I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was the first time she had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically like traveled out of America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she came from a very small town in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the midwest who you know got got raised </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the values that you would expect a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> small town to get raised in and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember she said oh yeah America is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> greatest country in the world obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember apparently she said I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and she said uh she said to me at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time she got like genuinely offended </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right she like she she straight up she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> she got like genuinely angry at me at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the time for doing that she was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what do you mean why and why why did you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make that sound she said to me and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like so what constitutes the greatest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> country yeah and why is America the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> greatest country and she was like Oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Land of the Free isn't it we got freedom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> seconds I'm like you know because I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about to say I was like if she's about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to drop the freedom bomb like I I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know what I can say to that no because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's to me at the time it was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> living up to the stereotypical patriotic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> America because like yeah like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> America is is a good country you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like my my issue is the more I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> travel with more I'm just like is there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a greatest country in the world and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no way you can Define the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> greatest country in the world otherwise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone will be living there yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly and to me patriotism as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> British person is just so weird like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see it you I see like American </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> patriotism where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um you know not saying every American </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this but like especially some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the some of the Americans I met who have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who were raised in small towns </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when I go when I go back to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney's Hometown it's just you you see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you see kind of like this culture and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this culture that's been uh and this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> idea that's just been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> propagated through the small town and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's not not really been any other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perspective to really change that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perspective so by there by by their uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by their like they properly Believe by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their belief they probably believe that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America is the greatest country in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> world uh and there is no other thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that can challenge that and it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just I like I can't blame them for that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know I'm not even saying America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't the greatest country in the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just saying that because their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> belief has been permeated so deeply that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's been nothing to really break </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that mold for them and it took years for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney to really kind of change her </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perspective it didn't take like just one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> trip to England it took years for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> traveling to uh to you know living with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me in England and leaving me with me in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thailand and living with me in Japan for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> her to like really open up her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> perspective to be like you know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe there are some other good places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the world as well you know you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe some other places do things yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's good yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and now she has recently just gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> back to America to visit her family yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she's like wow I uh I really don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fit here there anymore really yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's uh it felt weird because she told </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me that she just didn't feel like as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> settled as she used to be just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> she she had like she feels like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> outsider almost yeah yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely got that when I was uh back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Wales last time I don't know it's you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know I I love my hometown and I love my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friends but you definitely feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because you've been doing so many things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and exploring so many different cultures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you definitely feel like God I must </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sound like that weird [ __ ] Gap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> student who come back like yeah I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> traveled the world now I'm better than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all of you because I really don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to sound like that yeah I know but you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it does it does open your perspective a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> lot and you do think like oh [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it really does make you look at stuff in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your Tiny Town a lot different and uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know how how homogeneous it is the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Tiny Town just feels so much more tinier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah weirdly and and it's like and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know again like I don't blame like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney or anyone from like the small </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> town to think think that way because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again like I feel especially in America </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it really is just like kind of enclosed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it comes to the information that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can get about the rest of the world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it still blows my mind that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in America for example like 24-hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> news channels are a thing yeah but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> not world news it's American News yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for 24 hours and I'm like what it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> insane to think like this for one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's so much news happening in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America that you can just constantly run </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> news stories but also like there's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so little access or ease of access to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> information outside of America same in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the UK though really we get like we get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> trickle downs from America we don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really see a lot of inside America like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we you know a lot of British people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really know many of the states </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of the very famous ones oh well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure it's the same in Australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's all the stuff like that and we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have very rudimentary knowledge of uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of Europe really do you guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like world news on your TV yeah we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do we do yeah but like world news is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just mostly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's mostly the Middle East conflict </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff that we had a hand in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's rare that we hear anything about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan or Asia in general that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something massive welcome to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Olympics normally yeah yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> BBC scarcely reports on Japan like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have the BBC app and I said like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan section they don't do like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> article every like three days on Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh really it would be very it'd probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be quite high profile stuff in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah very wacky wow if they open up a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> new store with M M's whoa whoa yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh also I do think as well the fact that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of people think one of the reasons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why people really think America is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terrible is uh you know in the UK and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also in Japan I feel this as well a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of this like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bad stuff and injustices if you will in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the UK and I I think Japan as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably don't get as much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Spotlight as they do in America and also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything is [ __ ] filmed in America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure literally everything is on camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in America so like I feel like it's way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> easier to catch the stuff that makes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> your country look [ __ ] insane yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah when when you know there's cameras </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> all the [ __ ] time capturing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything and I feel like one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> main reasons why we see so many insane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff for America looks good you hear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about all these horrible injustices that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have been done is because there's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much video and there's so much uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> attention brought to it by the media I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean it's also as well the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know just simply the population </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> differences one thing as well but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also again it's just like that whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cultural mentality or I guess like group </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mentality of like it's me versus the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world you know not so much because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it's very much an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> individualistic Society where it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm the center we have that in the UK as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well I think the UK way more I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's definitely like that's definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the biggest difference between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> East and West that I felt living in both </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> different places yeah yeah and like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know whereas in Japan it's like oh I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't I don't want to stick out too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because otherwise the camera might get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> stuck on but it's hard right because on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one hand you get you get a society where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know everyone's comfortable nobody </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nobody ever accepts their boundaries but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's [ __ ] miserable so exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you can't have the this utopian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ideal Japan without also being very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> having a depressed society and I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like the problem right now is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like yeah regardless of if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> an individualistic Society versus a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> collective Society there's still [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that happens like the stuff I love about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the UK is also I'm near certain the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff that I love what is also the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason why we have a lot of the stuff I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't like about this yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> uh you know I mean same thing with Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah yeah so it's you don't you </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> unhappy because they're supposed to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the happiest country on earth right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so the people who get sad there or their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> life isn't going the way they want they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel more depressed because they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> supposed to be in because everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around them is happy especially in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happiest place on Earth you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] win like no matter what goes </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> are you guys patriotic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> only in like sport I guess yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well like pretty much the most patriotic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I get is towards sports but like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to like okay so I think well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whale's patriotic and and being in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> UK is a very different uh but how many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> times how often does you get to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> patriotic about Wells anytime England </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] up that's basically right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> basically yeah honestly that's what I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> saying it's not a it's not patriotism in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wales is not like the rest of the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> patriotism </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just [ __ ] England yeah I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just literally that's just the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> way or Scotland and Irish like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Northern Irish yeah patriotism that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why I feel like UK patriotism is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a completely different brand to other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because because it's you know we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get very proud of Welsh people obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we get the most proud when it when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it is to the detriment of England yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so you know and people like oh you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like English though right it's like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not even I don't know there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> actually nothing about me that is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> English </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm British and Welsh but not English </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so a lot of people always like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's English right that's it no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no I despise but but I only I despise in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a very fun way you know yeah it's very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> much like uh yeah yeah there's a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fun stories yeah banter right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you watched Archer the TV show uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> little bits of yeah yeah there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really weird thing that just completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could be caught me off guard so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um they did an episode about like a very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> very famous Welsh event that happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was very weird that Archer an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> American Comedy TV show did this yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a thing called uh true Adam in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Wales right and uh it's a small town </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that no longer exists okay because uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Liverpool which is a city in England </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah uh wanted a reservoir so their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> solution to getting a reservoir was to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just flood this town </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so they could get water holy [ __ ] I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you not so they had to evacuate they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally just made people just move wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay and whilst people weren't allowed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to vote on whether this was yeah so they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had no say they'd know say right so they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just flooded this town called true Adam </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and turned it into reservoir turned out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they didn't even need it in the end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they they killed like four people as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well because some people refused to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> leave holy [ __ ] so they they flooded it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can go there it's depressing as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because they're just like buildings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> underneath this Reservoir and there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bunch around the areas a ton of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember remember try out and stuff like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that and it's just it's seen as one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the most like injustices that were done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to Wales yeah that's pretty it's fairly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty shitty fairly recent as well how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recently talking I think 60s can you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Google it it's like 60s 80s around that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> time I think just throw out in tried for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sure that's just the plot to hear us yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't you higarashi they're like gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> build a dam and then they'll like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> protests so English people could drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> water and then they didn't even use it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's it's like what the [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> then also Archer just did an episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about it that's so weird they did a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whole thing of like they were like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wow that's something everyone needs to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> care about that is something yeah you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all educated on the true Adam I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the very basic story there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> lot more yeah other people can tell I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like when you're from a small </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nation that just doesn't get a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> attention from the world media in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> general because that's that's me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever like Thailand gets mentioned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anywhere right like like I I I'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happy if like Thailand is just brought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> up in any kind of capacity everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone knows my country now that's uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love it though they get like insanely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> excited and like anything happens like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just insane it's great I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> remember passionate about anything yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right I remember when I went to a con in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Singapore uh they're like shouting at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you in public yeah no no no no yeah that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one but like I remember I did a I did a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> panel there and I literally all I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally said was hello Singapore and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never heard a crowd of people like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> crying and screaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was as if like [ __ ] Elvis Presley </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> came on stage and like said their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> country's name and it's like he said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly the singable convention was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean I wasn't invited I was just there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we weren't tired at this point well I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't you know we we knew each other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he's like I'm gonna pop down to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Singapore yeah no the guy literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> texted me and was like oh you're in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Singapore finna popped down for a quick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> second yeah it's it's so weird sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where what we are as Southeast Asians </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are proud of sometimes because like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I swear to God every time I meet a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fellow Southeast Asian from a different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> country yeah we get competitive over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the weirdest things right because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first thing we compare is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um how [ __ ] it is driving our roads yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I don't know why we do that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yo you're still alive why is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh this one time in Bangkok I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in traffic for one hour oh when I oh you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think one hour's bad when I was in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Jakarta it was a three-hour traffic jam </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once I'm just like thinking about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like why are we comparing why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would this is like the weirdest dick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> size comparison I can think of oh you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> survived two car crashes yeah I survived </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like that's not something to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> proud because I was just like I caused </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all of them because after living in two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> years Sydney just went around to other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people being like you know Thailand has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Thailand is like second on like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> most dangerous place to drive in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world right and I lived there and I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like Cindy why why are you why are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you boasting about like why I haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even drive there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why are we boasting about that she's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saying all this like in the passenger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> seat </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> like where I grew up was like number one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like teen pregnancy in the UK as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well yeah and then there was just like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fact they were like good be proud of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well finally number one in something so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> all of your parents here are still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> teenagers congratulations that's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what it's like in a small town yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just I just realized that's exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where the same way as well Sydney comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from because the first thing she boasts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about uh from like Wisconsin is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like two things we are like we're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> cheese we're like number one in cheese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> beers and serial killers I don't think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a good thing Sydney number one in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cheese in the US is not a that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying you know your number one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> landlocked country in like some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know town I don't know I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this terrible comparison but I know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you mean it's like it's not something to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be like oh wow amazing I mean what is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> amazing is the fact that [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> state is the most serial killers like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's pretty impressive honestly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I liked uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Midwest is pretty chill where have you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been in the midwest I really like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> World in 48 hours yeah you just did a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] Speed Run I did basically speed </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] what the [ __ ] took them 80 Days the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first time you know what I mean that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what you did too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> around the world deportation hack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I used the deported skip right here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time I went to the US I didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know you needed the Visa right I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so so what happened we didn't need a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> visa before no we did we needed the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Esther that was introduced pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> recently yeah the yesterday before the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yesterday you didn't need it yeah the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first time went to America you didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> need an Esther how long ago was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Esther was like 10 15 years ago or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> something like that it was within my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lifetime that the uh that the the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> legislation changed well because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know you've been traveling through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Europe all my life and I just assumed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just turned out where you want to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with oh yeah I mean yeah so I didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know that and so I booked my flight to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the US this is when the Esther was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thing yeah uh which is [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America can come to the UK no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> documentation needed just a passport oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really when we when we have to go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America we have to get this esta </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nonsense right yeah so I'm I'm getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all my stuff ready this is my first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flight ever to America I'm on my own oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my God and then it's like midnight and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then my flight's at like 9 A.M my dad my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dad came in my room he's like did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> get the visa I'm like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what do you mean yeah you're gonna get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Visa who no one told me this how do I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get the visa about I'm like 19 as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm like I've never heard of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this yeah when do I have to get a Visa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and luckily uh apparently switch to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get it three days before yeah three days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh but yeah like more than three days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> before yeah but luckily it came in 15 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes yeah yeah I was very lucky I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also did that in Japan as well that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> very yeah Aki had to do that at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> airport once because like she realized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> her Esther had run out because you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have a really [ __ ] track record at uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> getting into country so yeah I just I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> losing your passport before we go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan oh yeah I remember that I totally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forgot because it only lasts for two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> years when you go to the US you have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get uh from most countries and also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Canada if you get one too yeah if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just apply for a thing called Nesta cost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fifteen dollars you do it online if your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> passport is like normal yeah like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> criminal record or anything you should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get it in like 15 minutes yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately but do it three days just in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> case that's why I suggest you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um yeah and it lasts two years and when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I moved to Japan I was going to go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> San Francisco and I totally forgot it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expired until I was on the way to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> airport when I was realized it had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expired so I was applying for it on my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> phone yeah on the way and luckily right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> before I was about to check in I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> got it and so nice I was like nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's gold split right there yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I told my company I'm like uh hey uh I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forgot to uh get the esta they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what what and I was like yeah so uh I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> applied for it it should be fine we'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see we'll see we'll see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> luckily it all worked out at least yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least you weren't like on the plane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when you realized that yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's weird though because they don't ask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me for it and they don't ask me for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't ask you for the Esther at any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point so I wonder is it just on like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> system they only ask you for it when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're immigrating into the country that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you just landed no they they asked they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they should what what uh airline did you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fly with I'm British Airways they never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've never asked me for it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I normally get asked when I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> queuing up to check in if if I have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Visa yeah they never ask me that because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe I'm just so Charming they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no no go in go ahead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> excuse me sir do you have a visa to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into our country this is really my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> privilege right now [ __ ] no but like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like especially coming from uh having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having dual citizenship in a UK and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thailand yeah it's just like it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> makes me realize man we are very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> privileged to have certain passports </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it is literally just some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> passports are completely useless and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need yeah Japan is like the most OP </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> passport it's the most powerful possible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the world yeah but no but only like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 20 people have them here can you believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah they're [ __ ] audacity and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also yeah it's there's there's so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like weird other rules that come with it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and also and again it's like yeah as you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were saying it's the most powerful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> possible in the world and yet barely any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese people fly out of Japan because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the tourism industry here is just so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> powerful yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I completely forgot I was just gonna say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that some some possibles are like pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> op and uh like that's that's that makes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> me jealous of your Japanese passport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you can get in like what what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can Japan get in without a Visa that the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> UK can't I'm sure there's something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wrong place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think about this but I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like in the UK it's something like 70 to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 80 people have a passport in America </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like yeah it was so weird for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to a country and just like meeting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people without a passport yeah everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just has one in the UK yeah everyone I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know has one yeah in Australia as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like almost everyone has one yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> guess I guess it's just like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> difference in culture right yeah like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't imagine not having a passport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what are you going to go and do in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> UK just go to like a field and be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sick this is great vacation or I could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and also get a passport go to another </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> country and go to that field yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly but like you know there's in our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beaches sure as someone who's born up in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Brighton so we have amazing beaches you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> want sand beaches no we got we've got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Stone Stones because you can't even walk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in it UK tourism is the most depressing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing on earth like it's just [ __ ] what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> would you recommend to someone who's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never been to the UK I when people come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no go to London it doesn't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're right is that the reason why I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think the UK works is a tourist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> destination is because you don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anything about it yeah you know about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the UK it's it's terrible place I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most people's imaginations of the UK is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the queen Harry Potter and the three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> things if you go to London you get a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> very sanitized view of London of the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can have a great time because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you only see London and London is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very well kept the Charming part yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's very well you know I love them all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] money's in London I'd say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some some of the country sides are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty good as well yeah I really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> appreciate it when I meet people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like love castles and love going around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> whales and stuff like that I'm like nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly if you want to go to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> countryside though I'd say Ireland is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> better Ireland's [ __ ] beautiful I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been to the country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Wales is good patriotism showing there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I remember when I I first found out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that people just didn't live near </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> castles I thought that was weird when I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first found that out yeah I lived near </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> three castles growing up and I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so you're like out of context that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds so [ __ ] privileged why what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what are you gonna do with it well it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not my castle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's the thing like it's like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like that if you said that to a Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> person they'd be like what are you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the Prince of Wales no it's because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know you there's so many [ __ ] castles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the UK one of them was very dangerous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and run down and like climbing it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like a safety hazard I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how it's still allowed you're allowed to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go right dude but you know there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's one really cool castle near me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like called I feel whales to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> castles is very much Japan to Temples </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah maybe you know because like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think if you said to someone who has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like no idea of like Asian culture or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anything like that and said like oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like three temples around my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> house they'd be like whoa you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bougie Japan did have a lot of castles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they were just burnt down well yeah most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of them are gone uh there is one in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a really big one in what Kochi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a massive one yeah a lot of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though are Recreations yeah yeah they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like built much much later I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's only like a handful of castles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like from that time that are still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> standing a lot of the ones in the UK are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> run down as well like the the out of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> three near me one of them is well kept </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's mainly for tourist reasons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and the other two are completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> run down and just like but it's cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's a bunch of rubble but you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> buy that right like you can purchase </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that as property </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> normally the big ones you can't they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> normally Heritage sites so you can't buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> them they're like public and at that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> point people who buy just buy four Flex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because who actually lives in the castle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> nowadays I believe I read something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about France or something as the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> abandoned castles and the most castles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for sale out of it like any country oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really apparently you can just buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chateaus and castles oh all nonsense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's pretty bougie all right you say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you say UK is good for travel or I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> never said that well what did you say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you say come to the UK then just go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> London go to London okay well okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genuine question someone someone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> coming to travel to the UK you want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show them you want to show them British </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> culture what did you take them to first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of all the one question you have to ask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> someone who comes to the UK do you drink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you drink yeah of course and if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't you're gonna have a bag because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have you have you either have you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> can have it if you love a beer and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> love drinking with people you can have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two-week trip and you have a great time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah if you don't drink alcohol it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> three-day criteria you're not doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> alcohol I hope you like castles I might </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know I genuinely think because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can do nearly everything in London </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's worth seeing in one day like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or two days one or two two two shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right but but you know like all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> major things are within walking distance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> each other do you take them to like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tourist tourist sites and everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like that yeah very fast and like his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> booking in Palace have a look all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here's the Big Ben have a look at [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't pay it it's not it's like 90 to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on it it's a rip off don't do it when we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went it was in [ __ ] scaffolding yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right so I didn't even get to see </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> people to Greenwich Greenwich is a </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> rarely want to go to the big tourist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spots right yeah I want good places I </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> just like yep afternoon tea [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> slaps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um to be fair I feel Australia would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the exact same thing if it wasn't for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the fact that we have some of the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beaches in the world like because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like because like at least </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> like beaches then I hope you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drinking because we're going to be doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of that yeah it's kind of hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had friends uh normally Americans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who are like no I don't drink and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like I honestly don't know what to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm yeah I can show you Big Ben yeah I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have the same thing when I when like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friends come to Australia and I have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> take them around like a couple times I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you want to see it's like Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Opera house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not an alcoholic but it's just the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's kind of why I wanted to move out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of England because it just felt like if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you didn't drink then there was nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> else to do to have fun or like just just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's a big thing no one no one does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anything on weekdays in the UK like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weekdays are strictly for working and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then going home and being pressed that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> all you do now I feel that's no one goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out in the UK it's always the weekend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh really even like even after work no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no one really goes out really yeah I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's normally older people they normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> will go after the pub after work when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like 40s because they because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're there well I would have you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some people go to the pub after work oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I know I I if I've worked an office I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would love to go but I was a YouTuber no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one wanted to go out in the weekdays </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right it was an absolute uphill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> battle trying to get people to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything in the UK you have to wait till </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the weekend yeah so I never did anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> during the weekend I just worked on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> videos I think and played video games I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't really know what I did I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know what I did in London what did I do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what did I do in London I don't know I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> went to Coffee we have really good cafes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> do we yeah we do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> compared to Europe we aren't we were in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Europe you guys are Europe we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Europe well we're not we're not in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Europe anymore because it's easy to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff from like Italy and whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's true that's true it's just that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one thing I miss about that sucks about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan is that importing anything from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Europe is like 20 times the price well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's like a block of cheese that I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would pay 10 pounds for on the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> imported from France isn't that which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> seen as like a luxury expensive it's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> first time I was in Australia it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally other side of the planet it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> depressing I I bought a wine bottle and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I looked at it and it was like 30 pounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the UK yeah and it was like 90 pounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> here in Japan </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> here let's be gone fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trouble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> one time we walked past and there was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maid that was like Joey remember that no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're there she started like screaming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> look at one of the mates what the mate </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> how do you remember this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually what happened was I was with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you we were walking and I saw the girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looking at you yeah and we kept on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walking and then I just heard her go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey oh yes and you I feel like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't pay any attention you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever and just kept walking and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like I do remember that actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's like yeah I heard her say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my name but I thought like I didn't hear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it as my name until I walked past her </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then a process I was like I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she was calling my name but then at that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point it was too late to like turn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> around and be like me I don't want to be </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> be refused to wear wash jeans because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the luxury no no no no no that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I had this thing for a very long time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well this isn't this isn't a meeting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a general thing I used to just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only wear like sweatpants when I was at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> home if I wasn't leaving the house I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't wear jeans I would just wear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sweatpants I still do that but now I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changed my mind and now I only wear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> jeans in the house what how do you how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you bring yourself to do that I do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that what because what happened was is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that I started just feeling like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like not working right so I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like me maybe if I like dress like I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> not a slob I might work a little better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh you laugh but it's it's a real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] thing it actually works like I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always I wear jeans not because I want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to but because it's the only way I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna look so when you wearing when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're wearing a pair of jeans nicely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they feel like better than anything I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like my day hasn't started until </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I try to work like an American </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fighting for freedom I just haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> started my day until I put on my denim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jeans honestly like so sometimes I try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to work and I'm in like sweat pounds or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes just in my [ __ ] boxes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I just I sleep in my boxes and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just don't get anything done right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I put on my jeans the day I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> started I am ready to work I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man I just wake up and go time to work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you go mine doesn't matter man yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you go to jeans just work harder </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it just get worse you know in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> one time I even went so far as to start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wearing like nice shirts like like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> suit shirt but yeah but suit shirts when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was making videos because I was like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was convinced that this is the next step </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to increasing my productivity yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> turned that didn't work and I hated it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right but I I I found the happy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> medium but jeans and a shirt I felt like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I can dress enough are we talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like a t-shirt or like a college shirt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not like this okay yeah but like I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the sweatpants were the the big big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> player because I basically got to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mindset of I want to wear outfits that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> could just go out to any social </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Gathering or I can wear this to anywhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know right right and so I felt like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it helped my productivity so if you work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> at home a lot and you've you've gone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into hell out of sweatpantsing all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> time you know maybe just try wearing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what you would wear to work but what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what okay well what would you do during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the summer then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like full on jeans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> AC blasting I mean I I wear whatever I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would wear to the trash days office okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's basically like my dress code at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> home but like I would never wear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anything too comfy I guess because if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Comfort is the enemy of productivity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well you can see if I'm in sweatpants I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like I feel like I should be in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> bedroom or yeah no I get that watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> TV one thing I do one one thing I do do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the morning to like get me into like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the work mode if I'm at home all day is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I don't wear like my pajama shirt I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like change to a different shirt you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a pajama shoot yeah just like old shirts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I don't wear shirts to bed why do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> why people do this because I don't want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be naked because I just it just feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like boxes just boxes I don't know it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just doesn't feel comfortable yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> feels like a it feels like unless I'm in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a sleeping bag I don't have enough cover </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> over me yeah I feel really bare yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and unprotected like like boxes I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> love I love using the body parts it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> temperature control so I put some out I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put some in you know depending on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> how much how cold the high needs to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay but do you okay do you wear boxes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to bed yeah sometimes naked sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> boxes see I like I need to wear boxes to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bed sleeping like completely naked just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> feels weird it's nothing used to thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know because the nut sack is a very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> delicate thing to kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> your nuts go everywhere and sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're more elastic than other times so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a way sometimes you just don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not sack rubbing against your leg </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like I don't know like for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not so huge that they're like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] sack of potatoes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when when I'm not wearing a shirt to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sleep it just feels weird to feel my own </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> skin on my skin no I get that like like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you know it's it's exactly the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> same like the only time I will you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been like brainwashed the other time the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> only time where I will go to bed without </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a shirt on is if it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> excruciatingly hot to the point where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like even the AC on blast isn't gonna do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it for me yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean like I need some fabric on me to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> stop myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's an Embrace </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like lightly embraced by the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shirt it's like it's like an extra layer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of skin that uh you're not uh that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sounded really like epitome </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like you're just like making me a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> very shitty reason as to why you weren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sure to bed it's comfortable end of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> story I just I don't understand why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd feel uncomfortable okay another </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing sometimes sometimes if I'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wearing a shirt my body gets even hotter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right because you have like a natural </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> body temperature and if it's like skin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on skin sometimes it like it's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a loop system where it like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> warms itself up a bit more I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> surely the shirt keeps in the skin uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the heat more no no I mean like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> insulation works both ways right like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you put if you put a if you put a jacket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a snowman right and it's it's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> insulates the heat in it it's nice like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they actually they actually say to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> preserve body heat like in like super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cold temperatures when you sleep it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> actually better to sleep naked than to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wear something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she seems like a lot more effort to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wearing close to bed like why are you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> complicating it effort yeah just but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just go naked how hard is it to put a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> shirt on for you I just think why are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you adding shirts into an equation that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't need it you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so then when you start you know you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start doing the business you know you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just throw the shirt off yeah yeah oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that just seems like a lot of work I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> always I'm always ready it's two seconds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you jack off do you wear a shirt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> depends where I am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I I it's never really a part of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> equation of jacking off I'm just like do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I have my shirt on what I feel like I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like the Michelin Man when I'm jacking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off wearing a shirt I feel like I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> constricted I'm like [ __ ] hell like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> get the [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> are you [ __ ] bulk up when you've I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean have you never done the business </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with a shirt on I have I don't like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it feels like I'm I'm like um in some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like constriction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like it at all you don't like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no it feels stretchful I don't mind it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no sometimes you need to like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes it's not the reason why you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know in porn they don't take this they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take the shirt off you know it's because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you want to get like that's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're on [ __ ] camera mate yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you on camera it might be yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know what I'm Into You </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Next sponsor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but also it's like you know when you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pooping sometimes you have to take your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> shirt off yeah yeah but that's more of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like if same kind of energy well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the thing because it's intense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay no no not every poop needs to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to take a shot I prefer if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> possible yourself you know when you wake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up I'm you know when you wake up right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're the first poop do you take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the shirt off when you do are you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right no I keep it on the poop like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> shirt taking off poops are for the poops </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that like fight back yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's when like you need to like like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need that extra push those are the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> poops that are like no I'm staying here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the ones in the morning are kind of just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like all right I generally you prefer to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just take it off while I poop anyway why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not not like during the day if I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> out in like a public restaurant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor goes for a proof and just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd like to takes off like the JoJo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> soon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> takes off the tie takes off the shirt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'd still poop faster than gone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know it's just like a placebo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's like I just feel more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comfortable wearing a shirt to bed I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know what it is I think you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> known after yourself in what way have we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> nerfed ourselves how I feel like you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> nerfed cure yourself because I can I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> poop without any requirements you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what it also is it doesn't sound like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that because it sounds like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> requirement is that you need to take a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shirt off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's literally a requirement we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we I can sleep naked I just prefer to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have a shirt if you're stranded without </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a shirt then I'll sleep with my show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he's here before planning the whole time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the reason as well though because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I've actually experienced this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like I in the middle of the night </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're in Japan right earthquakes right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they happen all the [ __ ] time right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if there's a massive earthquake in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> middle of the night I don't want to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that weirdo running out of my house butt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] naked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not Jason Bourne I don't need to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] ready for combat situations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every [ __ ] night I haven't got a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drawer full of passports ready to go in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I need to be deported you know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I this t-shirt is on the floor this one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> extra second of putting on the t-shirt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I can do on the way to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> elevator or some [ __ ] you know I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need to on the way to an element in an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> earthquake well I nothing is I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> walking downstairs I just have this like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mental image of just like if if an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> earthquake happens when Conor is either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sleeping or on the toilet it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna be that scene from Borat all over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I'm [ __ ] in the middle of an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> earthquake I'm Taking My Chances I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna carry on doing what I'm doing I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not why would I run out I'm I feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> running out is just a stupid idea just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> stay in your house maybe yeah if you die </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> foreign </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> specific situation no of course like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean because when I when I was you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know when we uh evacuated in uh La I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> felt like we did not need to evacuate I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt like we should have just stayed in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> our room I don't know what they were the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recommended guideline is but I'm pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sure running down to the bottom floor is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not the right idea yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the elevator during an earthquake is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably like at the top of like yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just had [ __ ] to do after it so I really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to get down fast so I was this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Chick-fil-A nuggets weren't gonna eat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> themselves that as well and also I the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moment that I was immediately put off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going down the stairs was when we ran </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> past the American family and that guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was acting like we were in like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hollywood movie and we had like he had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like three kids and he was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like I'm like I'm not I'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big in this guy's movie I'm gonna do my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> own thing I don't want to be part of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this that's that's when I decided yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that did like it was a pretty tense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> situation but the moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like the earthquake had ended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it was like whatever I was not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really scared anymore the building was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still shaking but I was like whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not a big deal the building's built </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for it yeah the building's built </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I was pretty confident that we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be fine yeah so I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever I think I I'll take the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> elevator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't I realized that don't take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> emergency advice I'm not I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> recommending it I I just I'm lazy he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just does it anyway I was just you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was I felt confident enough that I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to be fine same and if I died you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know sure I can have my Darwin Award in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> peace um because I'm dead so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know I can kind of relate to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that in like a tangential sense where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just like willingly put your life in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> danger just for a bit of control I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like it was in danger because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't feel that way because like living </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> living in Thailand this is going a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> complete tangent but every time you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the car and no no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not risking your life okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bangkok is the only place I've lived in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where people willingly lift uh risk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their lives on the daily by taking a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> motorcycle type uh motor motorcycle taxi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like daily in like some of the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dangerous roads in the world just to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> save yourself 30 minutes of traffic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right and we do that on the daily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I do that on a daily I'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's weird when you think about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I I can't really describe why I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just wanted to take the elevator but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think I just realized I was like I could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either walk down 70 floors of stairs or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could just risk it and take the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> elevator and I think at that point in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time to me taking 70 flight of stairs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was not worth my life well I mean I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't I can't argue against that because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I also win a new position </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was one of those things it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was like Conor's going in the elevator </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or if he's stupid enough to risk his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> life I guess I feel confident enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where yeah oh I'll go in with it if I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> die yeah I don't know I know that I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> shouldn't do it but I did so I mean we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ended up not going down anyway yeah so I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ended up happening was Cosmic Justice is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the elevator to get down you had to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go up to the 70th floor to the lobby to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then get down and when we got to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 70th floor uh they stopped all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> elevators Yeah so basically we went down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about 35 stairs for nothing yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically just Instant Karma yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right there and then we waited 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes and the elevator started working </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then there was no problems and I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> very glad that I did yeah I literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looked like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bobby was like went down 75 the stairs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> turned around was like but you know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when when stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happened I feel like I don't want to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that guy who's panicking and running </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around like all these people you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the last thing to do I just feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this is a b sheep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wake up sheeple this is how you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> inviting a shitty situation to happen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um you know and I also don't want to try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my chances on on the road uh you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because when you leave the hotel you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just facing the road yeah I don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to try my chances with stuff falling or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> well that's the thing it's like in some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> situations it's actually more dangerous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to go on the road because in the case </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with Japan we have so much like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> electrical wiring yeah on the roads that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if those fall and snap they can easily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> electrocute you [ __ ] you know uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> traffic signs can come down hurt you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I feel like the safest place is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to probably be on the ground floor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yes of a building I don't know you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> way more uh like earthquake vibrations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the first floor yeah yeah the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing to hire up the building the less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get like you just get swaying if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're up tall yeah when you're down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> below you get the [ __ ] violent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shaking yeah the best thing to do is to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just go out into like a really really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hard I I feel like this is a point in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life where I'm just like I don't know if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I should uh listen to this advice well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because the really the really the really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> uh the really tall buildings are built </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on like rolling mechanics yeah uh so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when the building you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> experienced it what do you mean the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel where you stayed in yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's built on rollers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> quick happens it starts rolling yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like the ground floor sometimes you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally don't even feel the earthquake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no because there's no there's no swaying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that no because you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting like the actual [ __ ] Earth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> shaking well that's that's that's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what it feels like on the ground floor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an earthquake on the ground floor right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it feels very violently shaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but it's kind of the same as being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on the building I I when I experienced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> both in Japan I definitely preferred in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in La when it was the building was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> swaying I I was literally on the street </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and sometimes I didn't even notice that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was an earthquake when people yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah because like there was there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no there's nothing to like how can I put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this there's nothing to put your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> perspective in that you're in an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> earthquake you just feel like the floor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is amazing wobbly the floor doesn't the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> floor doesn't move it shakes it does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] it shakes but a lot of the times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't actually see it moving until </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you look at something yeah there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's nothing to like round your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> perspective whereas if you're in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> building you can see other buildings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> doing this yeah yeah exactly like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't really most of the times I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even realize I'm in an earthquake until </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have something to like ground that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perspective right sometimes sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like living in Japan sometimes I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get up get a head rush I'm like oh was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so many like earthquakes but like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know when you're getting an earthquake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you should be like just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like my mom has the story of when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she was in school she was like running </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> along the tracks at school and like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know when you're running like your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> entire world is doing this yeah so she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was running and she was looking at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> school building and then she stopped and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the building just kept doing this and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she realized she was in an earthquake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she didn't realize until she stopped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because to her perspective it's already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going up and down right yeah but then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's I think it again it's that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like perspective of being like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not moving the way it's intended to but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> also I don't you know the shake the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> swaying and all that stuff I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really give a [ __ ] as long as like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know the building isn't falling down no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and if I stopped my stuff to break </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like [ __ ] falling down isn't it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's why whatever that was an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> earthquake I would just rush to my like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> camera gear I'm like hold my children </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figures please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> those are the real casualties and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> earthquakes I had those like 400 500 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> JoJo figures that were like very finely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> balanced yeah that were like balanced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the weight was like like this so the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> center of gravity was very worrying yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and during earthquakes I immediately had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to just like go to them if I was there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and during that we had we had one pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big earthquake and I was surprised </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because my figures just stayed up I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same way into the studio as well yours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't yeah it's weird because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> figures the figures that we had uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Fallen looked like pretty normal figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but the one that I really expect to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> break and didn't move at all well I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the same here as well like at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> old tracks I expected like Rohan to just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> be over all of these like knocked over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the only casualty we had was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Mike [ __ ] Mike every time I'm not at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> my house there's an earthquake in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I just assume my house was going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> demolished when I'm back I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything's [ __ ] I have to rebuild my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> whole life it's all ruined do you guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like the anti-earthquake proof </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff in like your cabinets you probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should do that no it really does make a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> difference does it yeah what is it so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically like oh I mean there's lots of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> different variations of it but I need it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for most stuff though I feel like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for very specific things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um I I we put it on most stuff like most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the big stuff will sound like if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like figurine cabinets or like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bookshelves this is like little kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they look like little rubber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doorstops yeah I know you put them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> underneath and it completely stops the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> shaking from happening yeah I wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get the figures to stop shaking yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I have I have them under like all of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bookshelves and fearing cabinets and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like that and you know I've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them move in an earthquake that that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] doesn't budge so that's really good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and also like there's also these like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little like sticky pads kind of thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can put on like some like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> figurines and stuff like that that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just weird that you have to like live in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a country and you just worry about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like like insta death just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> happening in the UK like nothing kills I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mean it's not exactly insta death or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just worry well I mean it might be if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're in the wrong situation yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I mean I suppose like I've we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been lucky enough to never have been in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bad earthquake I don't like like I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like we've never [ __ ] say it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well they've been predicting the mega </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Quake for like a few years now in Tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah where there's about to be some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like eight or nine yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] earthquake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hope to God it happens in the next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> three weeks I'm not here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus Christ I bet you'll wish you were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on the ground floor then Connor yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well I felt like the shaking was very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> violent I used to live on the like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fourth or fifth floor and it used to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shake really weirdly I didn't like it I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt like it was just high enough up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I got really [ __ ] violent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> chicks yeah yeah I got I was on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> eighth floor and I think with the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> biggest earthquake we were in which uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the one where earthquake earthquake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> earthquake the biggest earthquake we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in which was the one where the fake my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figures fell over uh I wasn't in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> toilet at the time but like that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> safest room to be in yeah I was in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bath one time as well but that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> earthquake just lasted for so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> long it felt like it lasted like two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes or something at least yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because it just it just started and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at which point because you have to make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this mental Judgment of at which point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do I start giving a [ __ ] yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because because most of the time it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little because it happened so often it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happens so often so I'm just like oh is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this the one I should start carrying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's not stopping should I start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> caring now but also what are you gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do if you give a [ __ ] like what am I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna do just be like oh [ __ ] I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worried well you have to like evacuate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to your nearest education point which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone should know when you move no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've got you got to get under the door </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> frame right if it's door frame but also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if it gets really bad then there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in your local town There's usually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like evacuation points that's normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if like your water and [ __ ] turns off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and all that is right um no in a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> situations it's like earthquakes and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> floods and stuff like that yeah but why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why would you leave your house in an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> earthquake if it's like that's true if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like unstable no well I mean what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if the buildings well it's usually in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the case of like you know if the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> earthquake is really powerful that your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> water stops or your electricity stops </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> your gas that's what I thought right was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to get like supplies and shelter yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if the winter if it's really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] cold and you know your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> electricity turns off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm kind of [ __ ] because like I am not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stocked up on any kind of emergency or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> disaster yeah we recently like restocked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> our shoes yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> two years now everything is good oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll get around to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no because I remember like uh for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> journey across Japan we went to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sakurajima which is that like Island uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or volcano yeah in kagoshima and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> remember like two weeks after we left </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there it [ __ ] erupted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like and that entitled it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like pretty b as well and it made me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize I was like oh yeah earthquakes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are like the least of my worries because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan is like [ __ ] volcanic area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like so many actors like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> malfuji's [ __ ] active volcano is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it is it is it's a it's an active </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> volcano and it last erupted I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about 250 years ago and they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expecting it 250 years ago yeah in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the other period it last erupted oh and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it then they're expecting it to erupt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like soon thick so I'm like sick they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually did a simulation if it erupts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> completely it actually reaches all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> way to uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh sure it's still that far yeah wow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of like a Yellowstone right in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> America well that's like one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> biggest active super volcanoes in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> world yeah if that erupts then it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like kind of like the end of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> civilization for like a lot of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah exactly yeah yeah because a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> The Waters at Yellowstone are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> boiling hot like the Lakes yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly yeah some horrifying stories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> people jumping in the water thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that they can swim in it oh and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boiling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know when it's so bad when do I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> leave my house I don't know that is is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it like a hard guide on where I mean I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean I'm pretty sure you'll know when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll know yeah you know what I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like when it gets to the point where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like oh I can't be here for a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> multitude of reasons then it's time to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go yeah the ones that I don't really get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> scared of the earthquakes in Japan but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the ones that do kind of make me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uncomfortable is when it starts small </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it just keeps getting bigger yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you're like when will it stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will it keep escalating yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when it starts off big and it doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> get any worse I'm like okay okay cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the long ones for me though yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right where it starts you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shakes shakes shakes and you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> please okay please please stop when is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this going to Peak yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not peeking yet I just feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the British in me where you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't take any kind of like natural </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disaster seriously I'm just like come on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sorry stop this now come on I've got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> enough of this natural also come on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no natural disasters in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world so you guys don't have like any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> natural disaster there's some flooding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but very light it's not right right oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we're flooding here like I I like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hear I hear like of like uh like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a weather warning in Japan I'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what the [ __ ] the weather warning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah how come weather my phone has been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on permanent weather warning since I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> moved here yeah but I I'd love to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine the first time like a British </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> person like went abroad right in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 1600s and they're like there's an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> earthquake like what the [ __ ] was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] was that yeah that happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the time what do you mean that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happens all the time if you Earth just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> moved the Earth just moves and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all okay with this you haven't asked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> management what's going on it's a living </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then like yeah yeah and sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the the Mansion explodes the mountain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> explodes and fire the mountain explodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we get these things called typhoon yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like what do you mean lava </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's hell that's hell coming out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's we've only seen that in the books </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this doesn't happen this is nonsense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's 20 000 and you accept this this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay with you it's like what is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> typhoon it's just a bit of wind in it a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> bit of winds never hurt anyone just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit of rain we get that all the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a bit of rain and wind what do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean nature destroyed your house and did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you get a refund what is all this what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is a tsunami it's just a wave isn't it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah when we think about it we Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really is like world number one when it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comes to like the variety of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things that can kill you in nature yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we really do have everything because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember before like I moved out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> England you'd hear about these disasters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that happened all the way on the other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> side of the world right it's like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Japan tsunami which is like an awful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> tragedy that happens and he just didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it didn't it never quite yeah like how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how bad it was like I remember just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before we moved to Japan where like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> guys are having like super bad Thai food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and typhoons and like the the videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that came out just looked super bad and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were just like I I it still doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sink into me that it's just this bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> here in Japan yeah as a British person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've just never experienced it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> IRL in real life like it's never just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> happened right in front of me it really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it really is like completely different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you could watch like hundreds of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> videos on it and the one that you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually experienced in real life is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like unlike anything you would ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine it is like it's like those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> typhoons look back it's a hundred times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> worse in real life watching like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> earthquakes from like the 2011 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> earthquake uh it's like really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's [ __ ] terrifying yeah just seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like people just everything shaking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> super violently I'm like oh gosh and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just like the water level rising and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] is like terrifying that happened 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> years ago man that's yeah that's weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah time flies 2011. holy [ __ ] I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> still in University yeah I would I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gladly take off um volcanoes if we can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get onsen's sticker stick a volcano </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> somewhere in Wales I will have an Onsen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would Onsen culture work in the UK if we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> had volcanoes yeah you sure yeah I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so I wouldn't okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just want you just want it to work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll make it work we'll serve beer not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> not if people have to get naked yeah in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> front of each other I I think you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> underestimate how I think that culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like just wouldn't work in the UK If </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you teach them from a young age listen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe okay but like getting naked is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> normal yeah you could teach a group of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people cannibalism from a young age and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll think it's all right yeah we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not talking about we're not talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about if like if the entire history of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the UK had changed to introduce this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> culture from the beginning because then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they'd just be [ __ ] Japan that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you gave them a free beer at the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of it like you're going naked with your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boys you get a free beer they do it you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sure 100 I I doubt if I if I went up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a guy from the UK like born and bred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never left the country and I said I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give you a beer if you get in this bath </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with this other dude naked when you say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it like that that sounds way worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because that's what a nonsense is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing some type not traditional bath </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they're like dicks are touching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like oh god oh oh I'm so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scared of people I mean there are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oncense white leather yeah but you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not really public ones though oh I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've been in one have we yeah remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we've been pretty close together at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the end of the cycling yeah yeah we went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in that really really tight Onsen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally it was like me you Joey and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Chris and like our legs were definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> touching yeah I don't remember this that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just shows how like used to you it used </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to wear it yeah it's just like nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to you yeah because I'm sure someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's not used to that type of culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would find that treasure someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially a lot of Brits you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine being scared of a penis there I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just couldn't imagine it like I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd be surprised like like not not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even like not even being scared of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> penises but like just like the social </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boundary of seeing your mate's penis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah or seeing you it's like seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone close to you and just knowing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what they look like naked I mean I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> totally fine with it now yeah but that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's because I've done it that's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing yeah it's it's like it's that one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thing of just like getting to that point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and once you're over it then you're over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it right but I think it's for a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people it stops at getting to that point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah maybe maybe in the UK if it was in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the UK I would think it's weird which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why for me it's like it's such a shame </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when people from overseas come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to Japan for the first time and they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I want to know everything about the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> culture you know like what are some like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really unique Japanese things and of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> course the first thing I think of is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> onsense right yeah but immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really I always hesitate being like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get this you're about to see my dick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in like a cool way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and like a nice relaxing way like we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a ball together and yes we're naked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not weird it's not weird trust </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me and we're with other random people as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well but it's not weird you know that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first thing I tell people now it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like you want to come to Japan you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want me to take you around we're going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to a nonsense yeah right well I should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get that out the way yeah I think it you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know if someone's willing to go to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Onsen with you they're probably up for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything right everything Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> culture yeah I feel like if you if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> can't trial by fire you can't put your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> own uh cultural differences aside to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> participate in another culture and uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I think I agree and and I and and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah again like that's what I kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> use as a gauge of like cultural </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understanding for that person it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if they can get over this then you'll be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> fine I'm very open to some things but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are some things where I've seen in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know when they had like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was it there's a TV show called like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tribes in the UK instead of dude who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went around tribes and like the Amazon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something and there was one thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he did that I was like okay I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think I'd do that and it was like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a penis inverting ceremony or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen that have you seen the video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where the guy like faints yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like yeah you know what I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> thought I was up for a lot but I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's where I'm good yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen the one where they have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like wear that glove of just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bullets yeah oh yeah yeah yeah like why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> would anyone want to do this because if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was you know you gave me enough beers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe I'd do the ants things but let's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the video of that guy with the guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like the tribal Chief does it to him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's a faints immediately yeah oh God it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sounded terrible yeah just just I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there are many penises like going ah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and yeah I'm pretty much up for anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't involve like destroying my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> body or pain or yeah stuff like that I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty much down for anything yeah I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> usually down for anything when it comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like you know especially when it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comes to things like food enjoy which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why I hate when people lie to me about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their like make a joke they're like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> our culture we do this and then they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just lied to me and I didn't have to put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my penis out in public I'm kidding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know this is why I trust my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends that when I go somewhere new and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like this is what we do here I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like I trust you that sounds weird but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trust you please don't [ __ ] me like God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could be like yeah so in Thailand we uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get our dicks out in restaurants and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> swing them around and be like all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well okay all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I would trust God if God told me yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right right I was like yeah you have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> spit on the food before you eat it oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> God I'm just waiting for the perfect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> opportunity she's gonna do it he's gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] do it I know he is as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the worst I'm just waiting for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the perfect opportunity to I'm gonna I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna do because I've only got one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> chance to do it too like do it exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> completely lose that trust Joe in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Australia he'll be like yeah you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> snort all your alcohol be like oh okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you have to drink alcohol through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your eye </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Australians do do yeah we do do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's called a suicide shot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just to have like a lot of shows in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> UK that would like cover like binge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drinking and like clubbing I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why we have TV shows about this okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and there'll be this one show and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is where I first discovered that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people did vodka shots through their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eyeball yeah yeah and it was weird and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they would do it and they'd be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'd ask them the interviewer would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ask them why'd you do he's like because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just get drunk so fast and I'm like is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drinking like not fast enough it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty fast it's pretty damaged it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty [ __ ] and then it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately cut to a doctor who was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah well actually you know in certain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any kind of alcohol in your eyes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> extremely dangerous and can remove the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lipid layer of uh yeah it can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> permanently damage and possibly blind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you yeah of course I was like oh you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know I don't need a [ __ ] professional </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doctor telling me that like it should be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> common sense yeah it's like it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sticking a splinter in your butt it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I didn't need a doctor to tell me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that didn't need to go there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's weird man I I it's so strange </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like in the UK with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> partying and all that there's so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff that you just do it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone else tells you you yeah we just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> always stab there thinking like what the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] is going on yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely like you especially in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> University where it's just gone just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the the idea of doing a dirty shot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now just like makes me makes me feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what does it do you know I'll explain to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the viewers gone and makes I forgot yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what it is either or a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> dirty Pine you just like you play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> probably most of the time it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ring of fire right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the University game yeah yeah and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have this pint glass in the Middle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where whenever you draw a certain card </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to fill up with whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alcohol I feel sorry whatever alcohol </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that person is drinking and sometimes if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're in like an Ultra Hardcore party </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you fill up with like other [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that you would never put in a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> drink like [ __ ] like washing up liquid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or stuff like yeah they would do it or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Tabasco sauce </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Nando sauce we had a rule in ours where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whoever lost they had to leave the room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for 30 seconds anything in the kitchen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could be put in the drink yeah so people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people would put like pepper grains </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> washing up liquid and like they would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> drink it I understand pepper grains are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like Tabasco but washing up Liquid you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> should immediately throw it up there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no yeah I've actually done it before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was 17 you [ __ ] idiot yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're [ __ ] because I I went I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lucky for some reason during my whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time at University when I played this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game I never got it yeah but I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have refused I mean we played for that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> game but we you know made it stuff that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you could actually drink yeah that's uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the Civilized I also I had food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> poisoning yesterday and I feel Dreadful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and hearing this makes me feel even more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Dreadful why did you get food poisoning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor I had a bad sausage you had a bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sausage I ordered two sausages I caught </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> one app and uh it was very very pink on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the inside that's bad sign I thought no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not eating that one but I cut the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other one and it looked okay anyway and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a sausage was it was it like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Italian sausage narrator and it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> normal okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> honor and food poisoning yeah you are so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> susceptible to it I think since you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> been in Japan you've had food poisoning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like at least three or four times yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> from my family three times this is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> worst food poisoning you've ever had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what like the the chest time I want just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of them yeah that was the worst one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you had food poisoning for like a week I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was [ __ ] and vomiting for like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> week straight it was terrible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh [ __ ] oh God I think I've only about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> food poisoning once in Japan because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they serve so much raw [ __ ] yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know they serve raw chicken </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here you know and they say like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no salmon there is salmonella </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just way less of it right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's you're less you're just less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> likely to get it it doesn't mean you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't get you know I'm not being funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you should not eat raw chicken like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't care if Japan is like yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> safe no I've had I've had it before yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's it's not it's not even that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> good it's not that good and you are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rolling a dice yeah you you can eat it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but you are rolling it up well I I had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> raw chicken at uh an Izakaya that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> specialized in raw chicken because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a lot of stuff there's a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> izakayas that just like give it it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cultural thing right where people are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just like this is safe this is safe and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like is it though yeah is it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it safe it's like you you are eating it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there is a risk there is of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a risk but it's you know you are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unlikely to get food poisoning from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> eating the raw chicken but there is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> still a chance yeah you can still get it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> especially way more than other Foods you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know right yeah but I mean a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things especially in I feel like in Asia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which just has a lot of a lot less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> standards when it comes to say the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> health and safety of the food you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> service I feel like I feel like even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like Japan compared to the rest of Asia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> has really really good food standards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah uh compared to [ __ ] southeast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Asia oh yeah oh my God compared to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> UK it's like Japan doesn't bat an eye if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like pinkish and I'm like oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my chicken's pink in the middle I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh God yeah I mean yeah the only time I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got food poisoning was when I went to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Philippines for the first time and </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> got food poisoning from it wasn't the </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> it's just like trying to pinpoint where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you've got food poisoning there is uh </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> past few weeks uh because I've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> living alone I guess for like the past </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two three weeks yeah because Sydney went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back to yeah see he's back in America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think this is like the longest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've been apart for like that time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's so weird not having a partner </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> home and it's just one the home feels so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> empty like my God like if if it wasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for Corona lockdown I would want to meet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so many people because I'm just like I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> need to uh do something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need someone to talk to I need someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to fill in the gap of like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> having no one in your house I didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've forgotten what that felt like right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot when I feel that I feel it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like because you're used to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah yeah to me it's like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> feel that way yeah I I now see why you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try to meet up with as many people as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you go because if I was in the if I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in your shoes I would do the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because uh it's uh it's lonely without </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having someone just there to talk to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes I really value being able to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like do whatever I want no I like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my alone time too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah a lot I like my loan time as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I feel I feel like any healthy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> relationship you have space to be uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have your alone time but if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feeling lonely you just yours there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just someone there also another thing is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that uh the chores are now like I have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm in charge of all the chores and I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like what is this like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna sound a bit misogynistic right but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like in in my in my household I'm in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> charge charge of the washing up okay and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney is in charge of uh of the uh of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the laundry right right and so I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just used to only do the washing up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having the woman doing the laundry right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> why did you have to say it like that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just wanted to sound as misogynistic I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just wanted to sound as misogynistic as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can because now I am there's no one to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> do the laundry and I'm just like woman </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where is my laundry done and I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realized I have to do it myself now so I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just like to imagine like I just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> slowly enter God's house is it from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> across the house I just hear woman </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need a fresh pair of underwear you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really got done dirty because laundry is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the easiest of the house yeah I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the one that does laundry now yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think washing up the dishes is far more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> painful I hate washing up the dishes why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> did you agree to that because I also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hate doing the laundry as well I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need to know I like the laundry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like now that we've bought like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> washing machine with a built-in dryer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all I have to do is just like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take it out and fold it up but I like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the process of folding up washing I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know why I hate that it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's meditative it's so unoptimized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just I just like because the thing is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the thing about the laundry the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about a laundry is that like at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with washing up it's just a one activity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing you get it over with with laundry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to put it in and then you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to remember that you put the laundry in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and sometimes I'm such a forgetful [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like you forget hours after you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> afterwards that you had laundry in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> laundry machine yeah and then you you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take it out and it's [ __ ] stinks yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you've left it in there for so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> long it's like wet so then you have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> re-la laundry your [ __ ] laundry well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that just sounds like a usual that is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> me problem God I hate the laundry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> machines often have this very loud thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> called a beeping yeah it goes when it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> done yeah but sometimes you just do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you might have heard it on your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> microwave the same thing sometimes just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing [ __ ] sometimes you're just like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> let me let me just finish up this piece </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of work and then I'll do the laundry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> country and then you just forget that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you hear that again that sounds like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you problem I don't like because I have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because if I'm doing work and then I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hear from my laundry machine going I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all right time to do the [ __ ] it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I don't know how hard it is really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not that difficult yeah also I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have to worry about dishes anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because we have a dishwasher so I wish I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wish I wish I wish that was I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like a caveman just evolving I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like discovering civilization for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first time yeah I mean like dishes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> dishes I was used to doing but like with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> laundry is is this how like is this how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like men felt in the 60s you know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because in our house I have to do the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the laundry and the dishes because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the one chore that Aki hates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing so she does like the vacuuming and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the cleaning up and stuff like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I I [ __ ] hate vacuuming the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> house but uh I also hate vacuum bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine doing all of it yourself yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly wow well I had to do that when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was living on my own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like now it's like but now I feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bad because my two chores which is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> laundry and the dishes I just let the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> machine do it so I literally just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> press a button I'm like done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's great I wish I wish that was me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I have to wash my dishes by hand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and my laundry doesn't have a dryer as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well dude I'm telling you man like when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you when you like the drives and laundry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> machines I feel like they ruined the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> clothes I don't like the dryer either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really I also hate having to put out the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> laundry yeah I hate having to put out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the laundry because this isn't good an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> old-fashioned natural drive and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of gets to me it does it does but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the problem with that is that you are at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the mercy of the weather yeah right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because like what are you meant to do in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the winter time inside right the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the best well I just hanging outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what in the rain the rain well it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> permanently raining in the winter yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but what if you have laundry that just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> finished and it starts raining yeah oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's unfortunate but you can just hang </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it up somewhere else yeah inside Yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> basically what I just [ __ ] said like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can do it outside it's not a big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> deal you know no it is a big deal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's gonna go dirty again from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the rain that's right you can wash it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> against even more clean see that's see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what someone living on their own </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> would say yeah I know right like I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have said the same thing if I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was living alone because it's like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's my clothes [ __ ] it who cares but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know I have to take care of another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> person's clothes and she doesn't quite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that as Anki get like no you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to do it this way well no it's more so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not so much Aki's preference it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also just [ __ ] common sense don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> train don't try washing in the rain like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a bit out when it's raining sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you put it out then it starts raining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you forget that it's raining she didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> notice right away and it's a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weight you're like I have to do it again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah at that point that's just annoying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right because then you just if I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like leaving out in the rain I have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> re-wash it yeah because that washes out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the good stuff about the uh launch right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm simply one man I cannot conquer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> nature I've accepted that right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why I bought a washing machine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has a really good job you're trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to play God no no no no no because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the here's the thing right here's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the thing because if if you dry your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> clothes in the dryer then you're gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> need to iron your shirts right yeah I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> feel I feel like if it's like naturally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dried sometimes if you get if you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out just fresh out of the washing you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're like uh what's whip it whip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it yeah I was trying to think of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> English word because I just knew the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thai word for it oh you [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> whip the clothes whip it yeah and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dries naturally you just get the creases </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> out and it's like it's like a nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes a lot of time unless you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wearing like a really expensive shirt or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that needs to be ironed yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like most of the time for like a natural </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> t-shirts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> um you get you get the creases out so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why I've always hated actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> having to use the dryer right well I get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that but there's also like uh we use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like these like kind of drying sheets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you like throw into the washing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> machine after it's done that creates </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> also you know like if you have like um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> certain materials if it gets oily or if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it gets stuck yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah wait wait so so when you order a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> pizza do you wash the pizza box when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um like I it goes on with the cardboard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like I no no no no that's not you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> supposed to put in the burnables </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the grease in it no because most of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time if it comes in like a plastic tray </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or plastic whatever yeah uh you can just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wash it and then put it in put it in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Plastics yeah no no no plastic Chef yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Plastics yeah a lot of the food trays </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> aren't like they're not plastic anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like they're like cardboard like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah paper no no stuff most of it most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of it is plastic most like most of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything I get is plastic most of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I could start so like what happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right is uh is unfortunately most of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> burnables like pretty much 90 of my bone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> balls is like pure food waste yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just we don't have a lot of food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> waste right right so it just ends up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that a lot of food like just accumulates </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not a lot of food like a little bit of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> food accumulates down because it's this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the summer it just decomposes so cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's all the more reason to take it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> out every week even if it's not full I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> have like a small bag that's attached to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the kitchen counter yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I go through so much tea and tea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> decomposes very fast yeah yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where all the tea and all the small bits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of food that I don't eat right right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's a tiny plastic bag that I can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tie up and take out every week but it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't smell yeah I think I think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not actually just the food it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's so humid as well that just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you can definitely get that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the humidity like condenses inside the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bag so like it ends up that you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the garbage water in at the bottom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as well yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um you should definitely get through you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can throw out tiny bags you know that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> allowed huh you can it doesn't have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> be big bags of trash yeah you can throw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a little you can throw a little like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> combini bag levels of trash sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just forget like yeah that sounds like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you problem this feels like Consulting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> people on they're recycling no I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what I was going to say was so so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously the trash ended up smelling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like at least like sometimes they throw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it up throw it out every week in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> summer but it's sometimes still just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> smelled right I really don't see it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> smelly trash when I open the trash yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so we had well in that in in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> case if it like if it you know I open up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the trash and it like really stinks it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that decomposing smell yeah I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> double bag it so like I close up the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> first bag I get a second bag and I wrap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that up again and then I don't even do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that the snow's gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because what we did was we there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like this there was this device from </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> Amazon already red flags there was this </SPEAKER_02>
