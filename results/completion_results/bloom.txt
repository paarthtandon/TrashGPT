<connor> Starbucks for the price that is just a </connor>
<connor> lot of money it's a lot of money yeah yeah </connor>

<garnt> like a normal Tesco's like yeah a bit </garnt>
<garnt> extra yeah and we were like oh okay </garnt>
<garnt> they're like what can we get we don't </garnt>
<garnt> know what the [ __ ] they were like no </garnt>
<garnt> problem we'll try and we'll try and find </garnt>
<garnt> some Tesco's to get some Tesco's here </garnt>
<garnt> and we were like oh okay okay and </garnt>
<garnt> they      </garnt>
<garnt> [Applause] </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's the one time in the life </connor>
<connor> where someone's like well I don't think </connor>
<garnt> I want to be here anymore so I just want </garnt>
<connor> to be here and I just want to be there </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what the [ __ ] it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's like it's kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> the same kind of like yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> every you know     </garnt>
<garnt>        </garnt>
<connor>       </connor>
<garnt>       </garnt>
<garnt> I mean you know I don't know   </garnt>
<garnt>       </garnt>
<joey>       </joey>
<joey> the      </joey>
<joey>       </joey>
<connor>          </connor>
<joey>        </joey>
<garnt>           </garnt>
<garnt>           </garnt>
<garnt>           </garnt>
<connor>             </conno      </conno>
           </conno        </conno      </conno                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              to the point where no one else is saying </joey>
<joey> that this is the best
fucking thing in the world. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like the only
time that some people </joey>
<joey> actually watch it is
when it gets to a point </joey>
<joey> where you start to be in
the zone where you know, </joey>
<joey> you start to be a bit more
familiar with the show, </joey>
<garnt> you start to be like, "Oh, okay." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - But I feel like that's
such a small step, right? </joey>
<joey> Because at the end of the
day, the show doesn't have </joey>
<joey> the same audience as "Dragon Ball Z." </joey>

Line 355

<connor> it's just like it's it's very fun taking </connor>
<connor> them around but after like like multiple </connor>
<connor> days of this I've been getting this same </connor>
<connor> question I'm like I'm gonna lose </connor>
<connor> my mind being asked these questions over </connor>
<connor> and over again but it's been fun they </connor>
<connor> love the bullet trains everyone seems to </connor>
<connor> love bullet trains as well every foreign </connor>
<joey> person I think people from outside Japan </joey>
<joey> just like find that concept so insane </joey>
<joey> yeah because it's like well like I think </joey>

<joey> like all the questions you have about </joey>
<joey> like the show are like very personal questions </joey>
<joey> but I think especially for me like </joey>
<joey> I feel like in terms of like my </joey>
<joey> Japanese uh my Japanese speaking skills </joey>
<connor> and everything like that and all the </connor>
<connor> kinds of social skills that I have and </connor>
<connor> everything like that I think like the </connor>
<connor> the first time I watched the show </connor>
<connor> immediately I was like oh I want to be </connor>
<connor> in that kind of situation and I was like </connor>
<connor> you know what I think about the </connor>
<connor> situation I'm like damn this is just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] bad because it's like well I I </connor>
<connor> don't want to be in that situation </connor>
<connor> yeah but what I will say is like I </connor>
<joey> think it's really interesting how I </joey>
<joey> found myself on this journey and the </joey>
<joey> journey itself and the fact that it </joey>
<joey> really made me want to do it again and </joey>
<joey> to learn more Japanese and have fun with </joey>
<joey> more people and make my life a little bit </joey>
<joey> easier for a little bit but also it </joey>
<joey> definitely made me think about it more </joey>
<joey> deeply because I was like what if I </joey>
<joey> just like just like maybe not make my </joey>
<joey> life so [ __ ] difficult but for </joey>
<joey> myself I think it made me a lot more </joey>
<joey> like open to be like well no I I I know </joey>
<joey> this is a difficult thing like that I </joey>
<joey> can deal with it I can I can deal with it </joey>
<joey> but I have to be careful of like </joey>
<joey> um I don't know like I I feel like </joey>
<joey> especially like in the case with like </joey>
<joey> English especially right because it's </joey>
<joey> a language that I know nothing about </jey>
<joey> it's it's a language that you know </joey>
<joey> nothing about you know and it's a </joey>
<joey> language that you know you can't speak </joey>
<joey> and it's a language that you know you </joey>
<joey> can't like I don't know how ugh ugh </joey>

Line 1451

<joey> take for granted in terms of how you </joey>
<joey> know like the way the country functions </joey>
<joey> for sure like you know when you get </joey>
<joey> asked like the littlest thing for every </joey>
<garnt> thing that kind of like adds up and adds </garnt>
<connor> up and adds up yeah every single time </connor>
<joey> yeah they asked me especially if your </joey>
<joey> dad is asking what beer this is </joey>
<joey> um like they had cover charge in one </joey>
<connor> place because current charge is pretty </connor>
<connor> common in Japan yeah yeah 500 to 1000 </connor>
<connor> yen you get a snack or something and my </connor>
<connor> dad was like did I did I get scammed and </connor>
<joey> I was like no no it's </joey>
<connor> it's normal but it uses on guard with </connor>
<joey> everything yeah yeah like an ATM he's </joey>
<joey> like is that ATM safe and I was like </joey>

<joey> because it's very like the most </joey>
<joey> foreign language I'd say yeah I mean </joey>
<joey> they ask a lot of questions about </joey>
<joey> everything okay yeah I was like oh </joey>
<connor> well I'm like uh I can't speak any </connor>
<connor> other language but uh my dad can speak </connor>
<connor> English yeah yeah I don't really </connor>
<connor> understand his life so I was like oh </connor>
<connor> okay fine I'll just talk to him I'll </connor>
<connor> just talk to him I'll just talk to him </connor>
<garnt> yeah and then yeah I remember I was </garnt>
<garnt> like why was he asking for a drink </garnt>
<garnt> for one night because his dad was like </garnt>
<garnt> how do you do you want to buy a drink </garnt>
<garnt> and he was like oh how do you do you </garnt>
<garnt> want to buy a drink and I was like </garnt>
<garnt> well I guess I'll just go to the </garnt>
<joey> nearest ATM and take them out and then </joey>
<joey> just buy a drink from the drink machine </joey>
<joey> and then I'll just go back home just </joey>
<joey> buy a drink from the ATM and I was </joey>
<joey> like what do you mean yeah that's how </joey>
<joey> much effort does it take to be like </joey>
<joey> I want to buy a drink and then go back </joey>
<joey> home to take them out and then buy a </joey>
<garnt> drink from the machine and then I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> how do you do you want to go to the </garnt>
<garnt> ATM and then yeah yeah you just go to </garnt>
<garnt> the next one and then just take out the </garnt>
<garnt> other one and then you have to take out </garnt>
<garnt> the  like it takes like an hour </garnt>
