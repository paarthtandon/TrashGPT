<title> the differences between japanese and american people </title>

<garnt> who are like trying to make it to america. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because when I went to </joey>
<connor> the UK a few years ago, </connor>
<connor> and I remember being like, </connor>
<connor> "What's this thing called?" </connor>
<connor> And then they're so fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they're like,
"Oh, we don't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> We just want to talk about it." </connor>
<joey> - No, because I remember going on </joey>
<joey> that flight from Japan to America, </joey>
<connor> and I was just like, "Oh, okay, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna go to America." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh, okay, okay." </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Okay, well thanks for
supporting me on my way." </connor>
<connor> And then they're like, "We
have a flight to America." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Yeah, I guess so." </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "Oh, fine." </connor>

<connor> and it's just like just the difference </connor>
<garnt> between japanese and american people </garnt>
<joey> right yeah right because like what </joey>
<joey> we're talking about is because </joey>
<joey> we're talking about here's a difference </joey>
<joey> that is so subtle that we don't really </joey>
<connor> know exactly what we're talking about because </connor>
<connor> we're talking about this difference between </connor>
<connor> japanese and american and like what does </connor>
<joey> japanese do to us and what does american do </joey>
<joey> to us and what does american do to us and </joey>
<joey> just like it's kind of like a very </joey>
<joey> different place to live in as well because </joey>
<joey> like this is like like a very different </joey>
<connor> place to live in Japan because </connor>
<connor> like the Japanese people live there </connor>
<connor> but it's kind of like a different </connor>
<connor> place to live in in Japan as well because </connor>

<joey> that I feel is very much like a separate </joey>
<connor> matter compared to the world of the
other countries that you go </connor>
<garnt> to as well you just go to these places </garnt>
<garnt> because there's a lot of different </garnt>
<garnt> cultures that exist in the world right </garnt>
<garnt> where one of them is like uh oh Japan </garnt>
<garnt> or Japan in general like there's a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> different cultures in every country </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but I feel like the world has </garnt>
<garnt> just become more of like a little bit </garnt>
<garnt> more open and like more open culture </garnt>
<garnt> because we've got so much more
open minded people now </garnt>
<joey> who are like really into japanese </joey>
<joey> culture right because it's like </joey>
<joey> it's like you can speak Japanese </joey>
<joey> but the Japanese people don't
really understand </joey>
<joey> Japanese culture and you're like you're </joey>

<joey> is that they speak a different language </joey>
<connor> than the Japanese one because </connor>
<connor> everyone speaks the same language and </connor>
<garnt> we can understand each other in the same </garnt>
<garnt> way that we can understand each other in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan and we can understand each other in the </garnt>
<garnt> same way that we can understand the </garnt>
<garnt> English and American we can understand </garnt>
<garnt> each other in the same way as we can </garnt>
<garnt> understand each other in the
same way but we can't </garnt>
<garnt> fully understand each other in the </garnt>
<garnt> same way that we can understand each other in </garnt>
<connor> the same way that we can understand each other </connor>
<connor> in the same way that we can understand each </connor>
<connor> other in the same way that we can understand </connor>
<connor> each other in the same way that we can </connor>
<connor> understand each other in the same manner </connor>

<garnt> is that they are like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> different, I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> They're all like different. </garnt>
<connor> - It's weird because
japanese people are like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, you're a different country." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> But in Australia, it's just like, </connor>
<connor> we're like separate. </connor>
<connor> We have different accents, </connor>
<connor> but we all have different language. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And the only time I ever heard </connor>
<connor> that, you know, British
people are like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, you're a different country." </connor>
<joey> - It's true, but yeah, </joey>
<joey> but like it is a lot more
difficult to explain </joey>
<joey> to people who speak the same language. </joey>
<joey> Especially when it comes to
like, when you go back to Japan </joey>
