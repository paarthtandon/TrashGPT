<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I did watch it and I
really enjoyed it. </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like, this is just so good. </garnt>
<connor> - I think, I think I've
tried it all on like a budget. </connor>
<connor> Like I've watched the
biggest Marvel movie of all time, </connor>
<connor> which was probably like the
last big Marvel movie, </connor>
<connor> which is not even in the top 10 </connor>
<garnt> but I've watched the
biggest Marvel movies of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> And, it was just the first
time in my life that I watched </garnt>
<garnt> something that I could not fucking relate to, </garnt>
<garnt> because I've really only
been into Marvel movies </garnt>
<garnt> that are like really big
and I'm, I feel like- </garnt>
<garnt> - The biggest Marvel movie of all time. </garnt>
<connor> - That is the biggest Marvel movie of all time. </connor>
<joey> - That is the most Marvel movie
I've ever seen at all. </joey>
<joey> - And I've also, I feel like you
just can't get into Marvel, </joey>

<connor> - The problem is that you have to put it, </connor>
<joey> you have to put the thing in. </joey>
<connor> And I had to put the thing in. </connor>
<garnt> And I just found it really weird, </garnt>
<garnt> because I was like, I
was just like, "Oh, okay, </garnt>
<connor> what's going on?" </connor>
<garnt> - Like you guys were like,
"Oh yeah, this is the thing." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I was like, oh, okay. </garnt>
<connor> When are we gonna have
another episode of Trash Taste? </connor>
<connor> Do we have another episode or not? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we've got our new
episode, this one's out. </connor>
<connor> So let's wait for
the other one. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, we're gonna do that. </connor>
<connor> - We're gonna do that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I hope so. </connor>
<connor> - But I don't know, </connor>
<connor> when would you like
make a new episode? </connor>
<connor> Maybe on Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> maybe in like the future? </connor>
<connor> - Probably in the future. </connor>

<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, some people, </joey>
<connor> I think I've been on the
shower in the fucking hospital </connor>
<connor> for like two hours, I didn't get ill. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just like, "Are you okay?" </connor>
<connor> Like, when I get ill, </connor>
<connor> I take four to five days off, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Oh, that's just so weird." </connor>
<connor> But the only thing that keeps me awake </connor>
<connor> is that sometimes I
try and sleep at night, </connor>
<connor> by like trying and sleeping at the same time. </connor>
<garnt> But it's like, I don't like it. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like I'm just not
gonna get better sleep </joey>
<joey> because I'm already tired. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And then I'm just like, "Yeah," </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh, I'll take a day off now." </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - And then I get up. </connor>

<joey> - [Connor] Oh, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no you do but you're
not a person to talk about it. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, it's not- </connor>
<garnt> - It's not a thing to talk about. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that is. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not a thing to talk about. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, at least on a
lot of the other shows I've seen, </connor>
<garnt> there are so many shows that
they just don't know about. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but you know, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's not, it's not like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not like a big show as much as, </garnt>
<joey> you know, "Domestic Girlfriend" or something. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor And Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's not like a big show </connor>
<connor> that's just like, let's
say, a couple of seasons in. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> But like I feel like, </connor>
<connor> especially at the end of
"Domestic Girlfriend," </connor>

<joey> - I think he was in a really big one. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it was like 10 or
10, 15 minutes into it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I think he's like on one of those </connor>
<connor> like, I dunno what it is. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, he was like, "Can you
tell me, a guy who's like, </garnt>
<joey> "I don't know anyone in my
life who can speak Japanese." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And I was like, oh,
he doesn't speak Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, "Can I speak?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "I don't know." </garnt>
<joey> And I'm like, "Can you tell me
that you can speak Japanese? </joey>
<garnt> You'd have to be the other way around. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm like, "I don't know
a Japanese person, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "That sounds weird." </joey>
<joey> And so I'm like, "I need to talk to you." </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "Oh, he's a YouTuber. </joey>
<garnt> I need to talk to you man." </garnt>
